  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IDS provides an additional layer of security to the network under the defense-in-depth principle. IDS does several things that basic firewalls cannot do. IDS helps minimize the chance of missing security threats that could come from firewall evasions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The main task of an IDS is detecting an intrusion attempt on a network and issuing a notification about what occurred. Detecting hostile attacks depends on several types of actions including prevention, intrusion monitoring, intrusion detection, and response. Intrusion prevention requires a well-selected combination of luring and tricking aimed at investigating threats. Diverting the intruderâ€™s attention from protected resources is another task. An IDS constantly monitors both the real system and a possible trap system and carefully examines data generated for detection of possible attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once an IDS detects an intrusion it issues alerts notifying administrators. Once the intrusion is detected and notified, the security professionals can execute certain countermeasures, which may include blocking functions, terminating sessions, backing up the systems, routing connections to a system trap, legal infrastructure, etc. An IDS is an important element of the security policy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">IDS alerts and logs are useful in forensic research of any incidents and installing appropriate patches to enable the detection of future attack attempts targeting specific people or resources.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS observes computer network activity and keeps track of user policies and activity patterns to ensure they do not violate policies. It also observes network traffic and components for detecting virus and malware hidden in the form of spyware, key loggers, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS works by gathering information about illicit attempts made to compromise security and then verifying them. It also records the event data and the security professional can use this data to take future preventive measures and make improvements to network security.</p><h3>IDS/IPS Functions</h3><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Monitoring and analyzing both user and system activities</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Analyzing system configurations and vulnerabilities</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Assessing system and file integrity</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Recognizing typical attack patterns</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Analyzing abnormal activity patterns</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Tracking user policy violations</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to its core functionality of identifying and analyzing intrusions, an IDS can perform the following types of activities related to intrusion detection:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Records information about events:</strong> An IDS notes down every detail regarding the monitored events and forwards the recorded information to various other systems such as centralized logging servers, security information and event management (SIEM), and enterprise management systems.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sending an alert:</strong> The IDS sends an intrusion alert to the security professional through emails, pop-up messages on the IDS user interface, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Generating reports:</strong> The IDS generates reports providing insight into observed events or any suspicious event that may have occurred.</li></ul></div>
