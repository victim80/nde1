  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Authentication is an integral part of VPN technology, as the hosts receiving VPN communication must ensure the authenticity of the hosts initiating and sending the VPN connections. Users must be authenticated to access the VPN and its resources, and authentication uses digital certificates. A VPN employs the following three types of authentication.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>User authentication</strong>: In this type of authentication, the VPN employs the mutual authentication concept. The VPN server authenticates the VPN client to check whether the client has the permission to connect. Moreover, the VPN client can authenticate a VPN server for proper permissions.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Computer authentication with L2TP/IPsec</strong>: Remote-access computers are authenticated for proper permissions using IPsec and L2TP/IPsec.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data authentication and integrity</strong>: All L2TP/IPsec packets sent are included with a cryptographic checksum based on the encryption key. Only the sender and the receiver know this checksum. This is to ensure that the data sent are not manipulated during transit.</li></ul><p><strong>Authentication Techniques Used in VPN</strong></p><p><strong>IPsec Family</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</strong>: All application traffic is secured using the IP network. IPsec conducts session authentication and data packet authentication for any two securely connected entities. IPsec ensures a secure connection between two networks or remote networks to the main network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)</strong>: This protocol initiates a connection between two L2TP connections. L2TP is always combined with IPsec to confirm security.</li></ul><p><strong>Kerberos</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Kerberos consists of a record of clients and their private keys. Only the client and Kerberos know the details of the private key, and Kerberos generates session keys that encrypt the messages between two clients.</p><p><strong>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">PAP uses a cleartext authentication mechanism for authenticating users. It sends a username and password as per the NAS request. The NAS receives the username and password in cleartext, which implies that the NAS receives the details in an unencrypted form. This makes it easy for attackers to establish a connection with the NAS to acquire all the information.</p><p><strong>Shiva Password Authentication Protocol (SPAP)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">SPAP is a reversible encryption mechanism that is more secure than PAP. SPAP plays its role when a Shiva client attempts to access a server. However, this authentication mechanism is less secure than the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP).</p><p><strong>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">CHAP is more secure than PAP and uses an encryption authentication technique, which transmits a password representation instead of an actual password during the authentication process. The server sends a challenge message to the client to authenticate users. Users respond with a hash value created using a hash algorithm. The server then compares this hash value with its own calculation of the hash. If they match, then authentication is acknowledged. The remote client creates a hash of the session ID, challenge, and password. It uses the MD-5 one-way hashing algorithm.</p><p><strong>Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">MS-CHAP uses a remote-access server to send a session identifier and a challenge string to the remote-access client. The client, in turn, sends an encrypted form of the identifier and challenge string to the server. This encrypted form is irreversible.</p><p><strong>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">With EAP, the data for authentication are compared against an authentication database server. The EAP authentication protocol allows new plug-ins to be added at the client and server.</p></div>
