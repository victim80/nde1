  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm (a series of well-defined steps) for performing encryption and decryption. Encipherment is the process of converting plaintext into a cipher or code; the reverse process is called decipherment. A message encrypted using a cipher is rendered unreadable unless its recipient knows the secret key required to decrypt it. Communication technologies (e.g., Internet, cell phones) rely on ciphers to maintain both security and privacy. Cipher algorithms may be open-source (the algorithmic process is in the public domain while the key is selected by a user and is private) or closed-source (the process is developed for use in specific domains, such as the military, and the algorithm itself is not in the public domain). Furthermore, ciphers may be free for public use or licensed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Types of ciphers</strong></p></div>
