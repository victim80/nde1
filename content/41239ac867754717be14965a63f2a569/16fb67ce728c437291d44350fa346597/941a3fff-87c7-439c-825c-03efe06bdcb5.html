At the same time, the Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of health information needed for patient care and other necessary purposes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Security Rule specifies a series of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for covered entities and their business associates to use to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically protected health information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The office of civil rights implemented HIPAA’s Administrative Simplification Statute and Rules, as discussed below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electronic Transactions and Code Set Standards</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Transactions are electronic exchanges involving the transfer of information between two parties for specific purposes. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) designated certain types of organizations as covered entities, including health plans, health care clearinghouses, and certain health care providers. In the HIPAA regulations, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted certain standard transactions for the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) of health care data. These transactions are claims and encounter information, payment and remittance advice, claim status, eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment, referrals and authorizations, coordination of benefits, and premium payment. Under HIPAA, if a covered entity electronically conducts one of the adopted transactions, they must use the adopted standard—either from ASC, X12N, or NCPDP (for certain pharmacy transactions). Covered entities must adhere to the content and format requirements of each transaction. Every provider who does business electronically must use the same health care transactions, code sets, and identifiers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Privacy Rule</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect people’s medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically. The rule requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health information. It sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without patient authorization. The rule also gives patients’ rights over their health information, including the right to examine and obtain a copy of their health records and to request corrections.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Rule</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The HIPAA Security Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals’ electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronically protected health information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Employer Identifier Standard</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The HIPAA requires that each employer has a standard national number that identifies them on standard transactions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>National Provider Identifier Standard (NPI)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a HIPAA Administrative Simplification Standard. The NPI is a unique identification number assigned to covered health care providers. Covered health care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses must use the NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA. The NPI is a 10-position, intelligence-free numeric identifier (10-digit number). This means that the numbers do not carry other information about healthcare providers, such as the state in which they live or their medical specialty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enforcement Rule</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The HIPAA Enforcement Rule contains provisions relating to compliance and investigation, as well as the imposition of civil monetary penalties for violations of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Rules and procedures for hearings.</p></div>
