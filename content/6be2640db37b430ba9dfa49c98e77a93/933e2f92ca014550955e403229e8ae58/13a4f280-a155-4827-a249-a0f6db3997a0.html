  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers are among the most important technologies in DevOps, and many organizations are adopting this technology to develop, test, package, and deploy the applications. Nevertheless. the increased use of containers is exposing companies to new security threats. Therefore, there is a need to secure containers throughout the development pipelines from these security threats.</p><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:  baseline;">The threats that are associated with container ecosystems are as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Image Threats</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Image Vulnerabilities</strong>: Since images are static archive files consisting of components that run an application, lack of updates in the image components or the missing of critical security updates make the image vulnerable. If the version of the image that is utilized to make a container has vulnerabilities, it poses a risk to the containerized environment.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Configuration Defects</strong>: In addition to software defects, the image of a container is also subject to configuration defects. For example, an image may fail to configure with a specific user account, and instead run with greater privileges than required.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Embedded Malware</strong>: As an image is a collection of files that are packed together, there is a likelihood that malicious files are included in the image package intentionally or inadvertently. Such embedded malware has the same privileges as other components of the image and could be used to attack other containers or hosts.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Embedded Clear Text Secrets</strong>: Most applications require secrets to securely communicate with other components. For example, a web application requires a username and password to connect to the backend database. When an application is packed into an image, these secrets get embedded into the image. This embedded clear text secret poses a security risk as a user having access to the image can parse the image to extract these secrets.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Use of Untrusted Image</strong>: The use of untrusted images can introduce malware, leak data, or introduce components with vulnerabilities. It is recommended that running any image in a container from untrusted sources is avoided.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Registry Threats</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Insecure Connections to Registries</strong>: Images may contain sensitive components such as proprietary software and embedded secrets. An insecure connection to the registries can enable a man-in-the-middle attack.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Stale Images in Registries</strong>: A registry contains all images that an organization deploys. Over time, it is possible that the registry contains images that are vulnerable or out-of-date. These vulnerable images would not pose a threat during their storage in the registry but can increase the likelihood of accidental deployment of the vulnerable image.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Insufficient Authentication and Authorization Restrictions</strong>: Since registries contain images that may run sensitive or proprietary software, insufficient authentication and authorization expose the technical details of the application to the attacker.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Orchestrator Risks&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Unbounded Administrative Access</strong>: Most orchestrators are designed presuming that all the users that are interacting with them are administrators. In most cases, a single orchestrator runs many applications, each managed by different teams. If access to a user or group is not scoped to their requirements, then a malicious user can affect the functionality of different containers managed by the orchestrator.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Unauthorized Access:&nbsp;</strong>The orchestrators have their authentication directory service, which could be separated from other directories of an organization, leading to orphan accounts in orchestrator. These accounts are highly privileged, and their compromise can subsequently lead to system-wide compromise. The data storage volumes of a container are managed by the orchestration tool. Many organizations encrypt the stored data to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Poorly Separated Inter-Container Network Traffic:&nbsp;</strong>The network traffic between each node is routed through a virtual overlay network, which is managed by the orchestrator and is obscure to network security and management tools.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Mixing of Workload Sensitivity Levels</strong>: The orchestrators' primary focus is to enhance the density of workloads. By default, the orchestrator places the workloads of different sensitivities on the same host. For example, in a default state, the orchestrator may place a container running a public-facing web server and another processing financial data on the same host because the host has more available resources at the time of deployment. Due to the mixing of workload sensitivity levels, the container processing financial data can be easily compromised.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Orchestrator Node Trust:&nbsp;</strong>Maintaining trust between the nodes in an environment is crucial. As the orchestrator is the foundational node, if the configuration of the orchestrator is weak, it can expose the orchestrator as well as other components of the container technology to increased risk.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Container Risks</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Vulnerabilities within the Runtime Software:&nbsp;</strong>The attacker can exploit vulnerabilities within the runtime software to compromise it. Subsequently, the attacker can utilize the compromised runtime software to perform other activities such as attack other containers and monitor container-to-container communication.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Unbounded Network Access from Containers:&nbsp;</strong>In the default state, most containers during runtime access other containers or the host OS through the network. In case a container is compromised, permitting it access to the network traffic significantly increases the risk to other containers in the environment.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Insecure Container Runtime Configurations:&nbsp;</strong>During container runtime, the administrator is exposed to many configurable options. The security of the system can be lowered if these options are improperly set.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>App Vulnerabilities:&nbsp;</strong>Containers can be compromised because of flaws in an application that they run. This, however, is not a fault in the container, but rather that the vulnerabilities in the application within the container environment compromise the container.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Rogue Containers:&nbsp;</strong>Rogue containers are unplanned or unsanctioned containers. They originate in the development environment when the application developer creates a container to test the code. If these containers are not properly configured or are not passed through the rigors of vulnerability scanning, they can be exploited.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Host OS Risks</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Large Attack Surface:&nbsp;</strong>The attack surface of the host OS is the collection of all possible points through which the adversary can attempt to gain access to and exploit the host OS vulnerabilities. A large attack surface increases the potential for an attacker to gain access to and compromise the host OS and the containers running on that host.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Shared Kernel:&nbsp;</strong>Compared to general-purpose OSes, container-specific OSes have a smaller attack surface area. However, a container has only software-level isolation of resources, and the usage of a shared kernel increases the inter-object attack surface.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Host OS Component Vulnerabilities:&nbsp;</strong>Vulnerabilities of the host OS components impact all the containers and applications running on the host.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Improper User Access Rights:&nbsp;</strong>An organization can be at risk when users sign in directly on the host to manage containers. Improper user access rights not only affect the host system but also all other containers present in it.</li><li style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;"><strong>Host OS File System Tampering</strong>: If the configuration of a container is not secure, it exposes the host volumes to significant risk of file tampering. Host OS file system tampering affects the stability and security of the host and other containers running on it.</li></ul></div>
