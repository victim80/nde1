  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The RAID architecture depends on two principles: redundancy and parallelism, providing a wide range of storage options with better performance and freedom from disk failures. The Internetâ€™s increasing footprint has led to an increase in the use of RAID systems because of their high data storage capabilities and management systems. Many available RAID implementations depend on the following factors: parallelism, duplication, and redundancy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a RAID architecture, a switch receives the data from servers connected to the network. The switch then sends the data to the processor at a later stage. The processor transfers the received data to a RAID controller. The RAID controller may be implemented either as a hardware using a RAID-on-Chip (ROC) or in a software. The ROC can contain the I/O interfaces, a processor, a host interface, and a memory controller. The ROC is installed directly in a motherboard using an expansion card, or in an external drive enclosure.</p></div>
