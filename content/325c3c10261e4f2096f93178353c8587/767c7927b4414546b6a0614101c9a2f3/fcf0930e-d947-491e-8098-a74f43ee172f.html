An effective deployment of NIDS requires a lot of attention concerning the network topology of the organization. The possible IDS deployment options are categorized based on the location of IDS sensors. The security professional should consider deploying an IDS management console before adding its sensors. Consider all possible options and its associated advantages/disadvantages when placing a network-based IDS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security professionals need to deploy IDS sensors incrementally throughout the network. Security professional must consider various factors such as the difference in traffic, logging, reporting, and alerts received when they deploy a new sensor for an IDS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security professional should place several network sensors at strategic locations on the network. The positioning of sensors will depend significantly on which kind of network resources need to be monitored for intrusion. Some organizations will want to use the IDS to monitor internal resources such as a sensitive collection of machines or a specific department or physical location. In that case, the most logical place for the IDS sensor will be on the choke point between those systems and the rest of the internal network. Some of the critical common-entry points to place sensors are listed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">At Internet gateways</li><li style="text-align: justify;">At connections between LAN connections</li><li style="text-align: justify;">At remote access servers that receive dial-up connections from users</li><li style="text-align: justify;">At VPN devices that connect an internal LAN to an external LAN</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Between subnets that are separated by switches</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">If an organization is planning to monitor intrusions targeting internal servers such as DNS servers or mail servers, then it must place a sensor inside the firewall on the segment that connects the firewall to the internal network. The logic behind this is that the firewall will prevent a vast majority of attacks aimed at the organization, and regular monitoring of firewall logs will identify them. The IDS on the internal segment will detect some of those attacks that manage to get through the firewall.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If a firewall is in place to protect the network then positioning sensors inside the firewall is more secure than placing a sensor outside the firewall at a position exposed to the Internet. If it is placed outside the firewall, it can become the major focus for attacks. A more secure location to place a sensor is behind the firewall in the DMZ.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Different options for the deployment of sensors in the network are discussed below.</p></div>
