  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In hub-and-spoke technology, the main organization is considered the hub, and its remote offices are considered the spokes. The spokes access the VPN through the hub. This topology is mainly used in banking and international organizations. The hub controls the following two types of communication:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Communication between a spoke and hub</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Communication between spokes</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">This topology is used to represent an intranet VPN connecting an organizationâ€™s main office to its regional offices. The hubs facilitate the sharing of large amounts of data. There are separate tunnels for data transfer between the hub and a spoke. All data transfers occur through the hub. The hub-and-spoke topology can become a multilevel topology depending on the growth of the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a multi-site network, the central hub controls the data transfer or is considered the gateway for the remote sites to communicate with each other. For example, a cell-phone tower in an area is the hub, and all the mobile devices in and around the cell-phone tower are the spokes. A security professional must always thoroughly study the hub-and-spoke technology in their network.</p><p><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">The hub-and-spoke topology is relatively less expensive and easy to repair when one of the spokes fails.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Bonded circuits between the hub and a spoke increase the flexibility of the network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">This topology offers enhanced security, as each device in the network is separated from others through a single connection to the hub.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">This topology provides high performance, centralization, and simplicity.</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Any issue in the hub can affect the connection between the hub and a spoke and the connection between different spokes.</li></ul></div>
