These layers are designed in such a manner that they can meet the requirements of various sectors such as societies, industries, enterprises, and governments. The layers of the IoT architecture are connected to gather, save, and process data. The functions performed by various building blocks are as follows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gateways&nbsp;</strong>are devices through which data are transmitted from things to the cloud and vice versa. They provide the following functions:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Pre-processing and filtering of data before transmitting them to the cloud, enabling lesser data volumes for detailed processing and storing</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Sending control commands from the cloud to things to let the things execute the commands using their actuators</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud gateways</strong> have the following features:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Data compression</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Securing data transfer between field gateways and cloud IoT servers</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Ensuring compatibility with different protocols</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Communicating with field gateways through various protocols based on the protocol supported by gateways</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Streaming data processors&nbsp;</strong>ensure that no data can be lost or corrupted by providing the following features:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Effective input data transition to a data lake</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Application control</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data lakes&nbsp;</strong>store the data produced by the connected devices in the natural format. If the data are required for meaningful insights, the data will be extracted from a data lake and loaded to a big data warehouse.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Big data warehouses&nbsp;</strong>contain only cleaned, structured, and matched data. They can store the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Context information about the things and devices; examples include the locations of sensors</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Commands sent by control applications to things</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data analytics&nbsp;</strong>help data analysts find trends and obtain actionable insights by using the data in the big data warehouse. The analysis of the data in the form of schemas, diagrams, and infographics reveals the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Device performance</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Inefficiencies of the IoT system and ways to enhance it</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, manually found correlations and patterns further help create algorithms for control applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Machine learning&nbsp;</strong>allows data analysts to create models for control applications. These models are updated regularly depending on the data in a big data warehouse. Examples include models for recognizing the patterns of an organization’s employee behavior in terms of when they leave and return to the organization and adjusting the lights in the premises accordingly. After completing the phase of testing the applicability and efficiency of these models, they start to be used by control applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Control applications&nbsp;</strong>send automatic commands and alerts to actuators. For example, if a pre-failure situation arises in an organization’s equipment/devices, the sensors monitor the state of the devices, and the IoT system sends automatic notifications to system engineers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The stored commands in a big data warehouse sent by control applications to actuators help in the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Investigating problematic cases; for example, checking the connectivity, gateways, and actuators if the actuators fail to execute the commands sent by a control application</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Enhancing security by identifying security breaches (possible when detecting unusual or huge amounts of commands)</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The control applications can be of the following two types:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Rule-based control applications that operate based on the rules set by specialists</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Machine-learning-based control applications that use models, which can be updated regularly with the data stored in a big data warehouse</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>User applications (web or mobile applications)&nbsp;</strong>help change the behavior of the application controls. For example, if an IoT system performs certain actions poorly, user applications allow users to do the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Connect to an IoT system</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Monitor and control (by sending commands to control applications and setting options for automatic behavior) smart things while they are connected to a network of similar things.</li></ul></div>
