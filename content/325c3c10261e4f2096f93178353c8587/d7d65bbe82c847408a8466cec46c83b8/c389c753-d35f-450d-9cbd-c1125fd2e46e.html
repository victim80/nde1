  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An ideal IDS should have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Organizations should have an IDS that can run without or with minimal human intervention. The configuration of the system monitors and detects all suspicious activities on the host system. However, administrators should have all the privileges in auditing and monitoring for this to work.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Even if the host system fails or crashes, the IDS should still function reliably. It is advisable to configure the IDS so it is fault tolerant and does not require a reconfiguration or reboot every time the host system fails. In addition, it should be capable of monitoring itself to avoid any damage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An IDS should provide features for halting and blocking attacks. These attacks can occur from any application or software. This also involves alerting the security professional through online, mobile, or email notification. The method of notification depends on the configuration setup by the administrator.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">By having information gathering capabilities, an IDS helps a security professional detect the type of attack, source of the attack, and the effects the attack caused in the network. Gathering evidence for a cyber-forensic investigation is one of the required characteristics of an IDS.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In large organizations, an IDS is built with a fail-safe feature to help hide itself in the network. This feature helps create a fake network to attract intruders to as well as for analyzing the possibilities of different types of attacks. It also helps in vulnerability analysis of the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Not easily deceived. An IDS should be able to detect changes in the files of the system or network. The file checker feature in an IDS notifies the security professional if the intruder made any sort of alteration to the files. The IDS should report every activity that has occurred on the network as this aids the security professional when analyzing vulnerabilities and rectifying them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Tailored to specific system needs. When recursive changes occur in the network, an IDS should be adaptable to these changes. This also includes adapting different defense mechanisms for every different system in the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Minimal overhead on the system. The configuration of an IDS should be such that it does not cause overheads in the network or system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Resistant to subversion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Observe deviations from normal behavior.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Copes with dynamic system behavior.</li></ul></div>
