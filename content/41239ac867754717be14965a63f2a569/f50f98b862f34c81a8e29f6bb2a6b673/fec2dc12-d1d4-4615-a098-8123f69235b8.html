Each of these aspects have different purposes; hence, they cannot be combined into one document. Examples of regulatory frameworks include the Payment Card Industry—Data Security Standard (PCI–DSS) Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data.</p><p><strong>Policies</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Policies are high-level statements dealing with the administrative network security of an organization. These are leveraged by an organization’s senior management. Organizations require at least one policy in place. A policy is viewed as a business mandate and has a top-down management. Some examples of policy include email and encryption policies. They generally outline the</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Security roles and responsibilities,</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Scope of information to be secured,</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Description of the required controls for securing information, and</li><li style="text-align:justify;">References to standards and guidelines that support the policies.</li></ul><p><strong>Standards</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Standards comprise specific low-level mandatory controls or controls related to the implementation of a specific technology useful for enforcing and supporting policies and ensuring consistent businesses security. As noted earlier, this includes password policy such as password standards for password complexity, or encryption policy, which include standards such as data encryption standard (DES), advanced encryption standard (AES), and Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithms.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Procedures, Practices, and Guidelines</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Procedures or standard operating procedures (SOP) comprise step-wise instructions useful for implementing the controls that are defined by multiple policies, standards, and guidelines such as a procedure for secure Windows installation or data encryption procedure, practices, and guidelines.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Guidelines comprise recommendations, but non-mandatory controls, as well as general statements, administrative instructions, or best practices useful for supporting standards or acting as a reference when no standards in place. Guidelines and best practices are interchangeable. These changes are environment-dependent and must be reviewed more often than standards and policies. For example, a standard may state that a password should be eight characters or more, while a supporting guideline may state that it is also a best practice to follow password expiration and data encryption guidelines.</p></div>
