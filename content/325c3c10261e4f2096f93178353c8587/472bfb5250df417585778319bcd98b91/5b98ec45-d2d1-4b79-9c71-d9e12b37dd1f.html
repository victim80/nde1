  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Circuit level gateways work at the session layer of the OSI model, or the TCP layer of TCP/IP. &nbsp;They monitor the TCP handshake between packets to determine whether a requested session is legitimate or not. Information passed to a remote computer through a circuit-level gateway appears to have originated from the gateway.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The circuit-level gateway firewall uses the data present in the headers of data packets to perform its action. It is not a stand-alone firewall, but it works in coordination with other firewalls such as packet filter and application proxy to perform its functions. Information passed to a remote computer through a circuit-level gateway appears to have originated from the gateway. Thus, circuit-level gateway firewalls have the ability to hide the information of network they protect. These firewalls are relatively inexpensive.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Traffic is filtered based on specified session rules, such as when a session is initiated by a recognized computer. Unknown traffic is only allowed up to level 3 of the network stack.</p></div>
