  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">FTP offers neither a secure network environment nor secure user authentication. Individuals do not need authentication to access an FTP server in a network. This provides an easy method for attackers to enter the network and access resources. FTP does not provide encryption in the data transfer process, and the data transfer between the sender and receiver is in plain text. Consequently, critical information such as usernames and passwords are exposed to attackers. The implementation of FTP in an organizationâ€™s network leaves the data accessible to external sources. Deploying FTP in a network can lead to types of attacks such as FTP bounce, FTP brute force, and packet sniffing attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Wireshark provides complete information about the FTP traffic on a network for monitoring. Applying an FTP filter helps detect unauthorized sessions running on the server. Apart from monitoring the traffic on the FTP server, the existing file contents and file sizes in the server should be monitored.</p></div>
