  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Password Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In password authentication, users are required to provide usernames and the passwords to prove their identity to a system, application, or a network. These are then matched against a list of authorized users in the database/Windows AD. Once matched, the users can access the system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The user password should follow standard password creation practices, including a mixture of alphabets, numbers, and special characters and having a length greater than 8 characters (since small passwords are easy to guess).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Password authentication is vulnerable to brute force attacks or dictionary attacks, e.g., a person trying possible combinations of characters to guess the password or capture packets using a “packet sniffer” while sending data across the network as plain text.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>S</strong><strong>mart Card Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Organizations use smart card technology to ensure strong authentication. Smart cards can store password files, authentication tokens, one-time password files, biometric templates, etc. This technology is used with another authentication token, thus providing multifactor authentication. This enables efficient logical access security. This technology is applied in VPN authentication, email and data encryption, electronic signatures, secure wireless logon, and biometric authentication.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A smart card consists of a small computer chip that stores personal information of the user for identification. These cards are inserted into a machine for authentication, and a personal identification number (PIN) is input for processing the authentication information on the card. Smart cards also help in storing public and private keys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Smart card authentication is a cryptography-based authentication technique and provides stronger security than password authentication. The main advantage of using a smart card is that it eliminates the risk of credential theft from a computer because credentials are stored in the card’s chip. However, only a limited amount of information can be stored in the card’s microchip.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages of smart cards:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Highly secure technology</strong>: The smart card technology uses efficient encryption and authentication methods, thus increasing the security of the card.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easy to carry</strong>: Smart cards are easy to carry and a user simply needs to know the PIN of the card.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduced chances of deception by users</strong>: A smart card enables users to store information such as their fingerprint and other biometric details, thereby allowing organizations to recognize their employees.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of smart cards:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easily lost</strong>: Since smart cards are small in size, the chances of losing them are very high.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security issues</strong>: Losing a smart card puts its owner’s information and identity at great risk.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High cost of production</strong>: As smart cards have microchips and other encryption technologies; their production cost is high.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Biometric Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Biometrics is a technology which identifies human characteristics for authenticating people. The most commonly used biometrics are fingerprint scanner, retina scanner, facial recognition, DNA, and voice recognition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Biometric authentication involves the following steps:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The reader scans the biometric data</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A software converts the scanned information into a digital form and compares it against the biometric data stored in the database</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If both data match, then it confirms the authenticity of the user and allows permission.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The different types of identification techniques used in biometrics are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fingerprint scanning</strong>: Compares two fingerprints for verification and identification on the basis of the patterns on the finger. The patterns depend on the ridges and minutia points that differentiate each user’s fingerprints.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Retinal scanning</strong>: Compares and identifies a user on the basis of the distinctive patterns of the retina blood vessels.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Iris scanning</strong>: Compares and identifies the images of the iris of one or both eyes of a user. The iris pattern differs from one person to another.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vein structure recognition</strong>: Compares and identifies the patterns produced by a user’s veins. Each person has a different pattern depending on the flow of blood.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Face recognition</strong>: Compares and identifies a person on the basis of the facial features from an image or a video source.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Voice recognition</strong>: Compares and identifies a person on the basis of the voice patterns or speech patterns.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages of biometrics:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It is difficult to tamper with biometric data, in contrast to passwords or usernames. They cannot be shared or stolen using social engineering techniques. Biometric authentication requires the presence of the user, which reduces the chances unauthorized access.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of biometrics:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It is difficult to change the biometric factors if this information has been compromised.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Retinal scan and vein structure scanning can create privacy issues. Both retinal scan and vein structure scan information may inadvertently disclose a medical condition.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Two-factor Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Two-factor authentication is a process where a system confirms the user identification in two steps. The users could use a physical entity such as a security token as one of the credentials and the other credential can include security codes.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Two-factor authentication depends on three factors:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Something you have</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Something you know</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Something you are</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The factor “Something you are” is the best companion of two-factor authentication as it is considered as the hardest to forge or spoof.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A bank card – A user is required to swipe the bank card and enter a PIN while accessing the bank card. Here, the bank card is the physical entity and the PIN is the security code.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The advantage of the two-factor authentication includes decreasing the chances of identity theft and phishing. However, there are certain drawbacks of this two-step process. There are situations where the user will have to wait for the organization to issue the physical token to the user. The delay in receiving the token results in the users waiting for a long time to access their private data.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Identity evaluation depends on knowledge, possession, and inherent factors. Out of these, inherent factors are difficult to change as they depend on the characteristics of a human being.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are many combinations available in the two-factor authentication process. The most commonly found combinations are:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Password and smart card</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Password and biometrics</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Password and one-time password (OTP)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Smart card and biometrics</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Two-factor authentications performed without using tokens are called tokenless authentication. They can be implemented quickly across the network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single Sign-on (SSO) Authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">As the name suggests, it allows the users to access multiple applications using a single username and password. The SSO stores the credentials of a user in an SSO policy server. An example of SSO is Google applications. Users can access all Google applications using a single user name and password combination. Consider Google as a central service. This central service creates a cookie for all users logging in for the first time in any of the applications present in the central service. When the user attempts to access other applications of the central service, it eliminates the need for the user to enter the credentials again due to the cookie which has already been created. The system checks the credentials using the created cookie.</p></div>
