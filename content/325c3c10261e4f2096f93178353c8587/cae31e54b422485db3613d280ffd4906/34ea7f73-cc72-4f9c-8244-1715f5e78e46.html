  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p>An IDS uses three methods to detect intrusions in the network.</p><p><strong>Signature Recognition</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Signature recognition, also known as misuse detection, tries to identify events that indicate an abuse of a system or network. This technique involves first creating models of possible intrusions and then comparing these models with incoming events to make a detection decision. The signatures for IDS were created under the assumption that the model must detect an attack without disturbing normal system traffic. Only attacks should match the model; otherwise, false alarms could occur.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Signature-based intrusion detection compares incoming or outgoing network packets with the binary signatures of known attacks using simple pattern-matching techniques to detect intrusions. Attackers can define a binary signature for a specific portion of the packet, such as TCP flags.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Signature recognition can detect known attacks. However, there is a possibility that other innocuous packets contain the same signature, which will trigger a false positive alert.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Improper signatures may trigger false alerts. To detect misuse, a massive number of signatures are required. The more the signatures, the greater are the chances are of the IDS detecting attacks; however, the traffic may incorrectly match with the signatures, thus impeding system performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A large amount of signature data requires more network bandwidth. IDS compare signatures of data packets against those in the signature database. An increase in the number of signatures in the database could result in the dropping of certain packets.</li></ul><p><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Anomaly detection, or “<strong>not-use detection</strong><strong>,</strong>” differs from signature recognition. Anomaly detection involves a database of anomalies. An anomaly is detected when an event occurs outside the tolerance threshold of normal traffic. Therefore, any deviation from regular use is an attack. Anomaly detection detects intrusions based on the fixed behavioral characteristics of the users and components in a computer system. Establishing a model of normal use is the most challenging step in creating an anomaly detector.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">In the traditional method of anomaly detection, essential data are kept for checking variations in network traffic. However, in reality, there is some unpredictability in network traffic, and there are too many statistical variations, thus making these models imprecise. Some events labeled as anomalies might only be irregularities in network usage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">In this type of approach, the inability to construct a model thoroughly on a regular network is a concern. These models should be used to check specific networks.</li></ul><p><strong>Protocol Anomaly Detection</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Protocol anomaly detection depends on the anomalies specific to a protocol. It identifies particular flaws in vendors’ deployment of the TCP/IP protocol. Protocols are designed according to RFC specifications, which dictate standard handshakes to permit universal communication. The protocol anomaly detector can identify new attacks.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">There are new attack methods and exploits that violate protocol standards.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Malicious anomaly signatures are becoming increasingly common. By contrast, the network protocol is well defined and is changing slowly. Therefore, the signature database should frequently be updated to detect attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Protocol anomaly detectors are different from traditional IDS in terms of how they present alarms.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The best way to present alarms is to explain which part of the state system is compromised. For this purpose, IDS operators must have thorough knowledge of protocol design.</li></ul></div>
