  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Symmetric encryption requires that both the sender and the receiver of the message possess the same encryption key. The sender uses a key to encrypt the plain text and sends the resulting cipher text to the recipient, who uses the same key to decrypt the cipher text into plain text. Symmetric encryption is also known as secret key cryptography since it uses only one secret key to encrypt and decrypt the data. This type of cryptography works well when one is communicating with only a few people.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Because the sender and receiver must share the key prior to sending any messages, this technique is of limited use over the Internet in the case where individuals who have not had prior contact frequently require a secure means of communication. The solution to this problem is the public-key cryptography.</p></div>
