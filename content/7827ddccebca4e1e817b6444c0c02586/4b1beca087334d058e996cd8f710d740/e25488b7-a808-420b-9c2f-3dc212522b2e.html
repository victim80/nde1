  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The principles of access control describe the access permission levels of users in detail. By implementing an access control process, the security of processes and resources can be ensured. The process of access control should be based on the following principles.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Separation of Duties (SoD)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SoD involves a breakdown of the authorization process into various steps. Different privileges are assigned at each step to individual subjects requesting for a resource. This ensures that no single individual has the authorization rights to perform all functions; simultaneously, a single individual cannot gain access to all the objects. This division ensures that a single person is not responsible for a larger process. An example is the granting of web-server administrator rights to only configure a web server, without granting administrative rights to other servers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Need-to-know</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the need-to-know access control principle, access is provided only to the information that is required for performing a specific task.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The principle of least privilege (POLP) extends the need-to-know principle in providing access to a system. In other words, POLP entails providing employees exactly the need-to-know level of access, i.e., not more and not less. It helps an organization by protecting it from malicious behavior as well as improving system stability and system security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Least privilege provides access permissions to only those users who need the access and resources. The permissions granted depend on the roles and responsibilities of the user requesting the access. There are two underlying principles involved in POLP: low rights and low risks. On the basis of these principles, a user needs to complete a task using a limited number of resources in a limited amount of time provided to them. This approach reduces the probability of unauthorized access to system resources.</p></div>
