  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">To design secure and protected IoT devices, security issues should be properly considered. One of the most important considerations is the development of a secure IoT framework for building the device. Ideally, a framework should be designed in a way that provides default security, so that the developers do not have to consider it later.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security evaluation criteria for the IoT framework are broken down into four parts. Each part has its own security-related concerns that are discussed in the evaluation criteria for each part. The security evaluation criteria for the IoT devices are discussed below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Edge</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The edge is the main physical device in the IoT ecosystem that interacts with its surroundings and contains various components like sensors, actuators, operating systems, hardware and network, and communication capabilities. It is heterogeneous and can be deployed anywhere and in any condition. Therefore, an ideal framework for an edge would be such that it provides cross-platform components so that it can be deployed and work in any physical condition possible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Other framework considerations for an edge would be proper communications and storage encryption, no default credentials, strong passwords, use of the latest up-to-date components, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gateway</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The gateway acts as the first step for an edge into the world of the Internet as it connects smart devices to cloud components. It is referred to as a communication aggregator that allows communication with a secure and trusted local network as well as a secure connection with an untrusted public network. It also provides a layer of security to all the devices connected to it. The gateway serves as an aggregation point for the edge; therefore, it has a crucial security role in the ecosystem.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An ideal framework for the gateway should incorporate strong encryption techniques for secure communications between endpoints. In addition, the authentication mechanism for the edge components should be as strong as any other component in the framework. Wherever possible, the gateway should be designed in such a way that it authenticates multi-directionally to carry out trusted communication between the edge and the cloud. Automatic updates should also be provided to the device for countering vulnerabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud Platform</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In an IoT ecosystem, the cloud component is referred to as the central aggregation and data management point. Access to the cloud must be restricted. The cloud component is usually at higher risk, as it is the central point of data aggregation for most of the data in the ecosystem. It also includes a command and control (C2) component, which is a centralized computer that issues various commands for the distribution of extensions and updates.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A secure framework for the cloud component should include encrypted communications, strong authentication credentials, a secure web interface, encrypted storage, automatic updates, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In an IoT ecosystem, the mobile interface plays an important part, particularly where the data needs to be collected and managed. Using mobile interfaces, users can access and interact with the edge in their home or workplace from miles away. Some mobile applications provide users with only limited data from specific edge devices, while others allow complete manipulation of the edge components. Proper attention should be given to the mobile interface, as they are prone to various cyber-attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An ideal framework for the mobile interface should include a proper authentication mechanism for the user, an account lockout mechanism after a certain number of failed attempts, local storage security, encrypted communication channels, and security of data transmitted over the channel.</p></div>
