  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Why Do We Need IDS?</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Relying solely on a firewall for network security can provide a false sense of security. The firewall is simply implemented in the IT security policy to allow or deny traffic based on the policy rules. It allows certain packets to pass through or denies access if it does not meet certain criteria specified in a rule. It does not check the contents of legitimate traffic that are allowed based on the ruleset. Even legitimate traffic may contain malicious content, which is not evaluated during inspection by a firewall.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As an example, a firewall can be configured to pass traffic solely to port 80 of the Web server and to port 25 of the email server but it will not inspect the nature of the traffic flowing through either of these ports.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reason why an IDS is implemented. An IDS will inspect the legitimate traffic coming from firewall and conduct signature-based analysis to identify malicious activity and raise an alarm to notify security professionals.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Role of an IDS in Network Defense</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">An IDS works from inside the network, unlike a firewall which only looks outside the network for intrusions</li><li style="text-align:justify;">An IDS is placed behind the firewall, inspecting all the traffic, looking for heuristics and a pattern match for intrusions</li></ul></div>
