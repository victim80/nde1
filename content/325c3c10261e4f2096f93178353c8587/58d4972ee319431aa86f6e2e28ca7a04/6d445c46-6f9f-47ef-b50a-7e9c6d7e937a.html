It must be set up in a locked server cabinet with proper ventilation, cooling, and backup power.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network Location:&nbsp;</strong>The host is placed on its own network, also known as the demilitarized zone, where no secret network traffic exists. It is recommended to avoid placing the bastion host on internal networks. The bastion host should be located on an additional layer known as a perimeter network, and a packet-filtering router should be attached to it.</p></div>
