  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">For the implementation of the BYOD policy, the employee devices must be introduced to the corporate environment to minimize the risks associated with data security and privacy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Define the requirements</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Not all user requirements are similar. Thus, the employees must be grouped into segments considering the job criticality, time sensitivity, value derived from mobility, data access, and system access. Further, end user segments should be defined based on the location/type of worker (e.g., an employee working from home, full-time remote, day extender, part-time remote), and a technology portfolio should be assigned for each segment based on user needs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Privacy impact assessment (PIA) should also be performed at the beginning of each BYOD project in the presence of all relevant teams after assigning the responsibilities and collecting the requirements. It provides an organized procedure to document the facts, objectives, privacy risks, and risk mitigation approaches and decisions throughout the project lifecycle. It should be a central activity performed by the mobile governance committee (end users from each segment/line of business and IT management).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decide how to manage the employee devices and their data access</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the mobile device management (MDM) system that provides a minimum level of control, other options such as virtual desktops or on-device software can be used to improve the security and data privacy. Additionally, it should be ensuring that the corporate environment supports WLAN device connectivity and management.</p><p><strong>Develop policies</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A delegation of company resources should develop the policies, instead of just IT. It should include key participants such as the HR, legal, security, and privacy.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Each device (smartphone, PC, laptop, tablet, or even smartwatch) and OS in the BYOD policy of a company should be listed; devices with a poor security record should not be permitted. This involves only permitting devices with specific OSes or manufacturers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Establish a policy to determine a reasonable, binding policy regarding BYOD to secure businesses and employees.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The IT staff of an organization should be trained about the various platforms, devices, and OSes to familiarize them with the risks associated with wrong device handling or to avoid the security threats imposed by a BYOD work environment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The BYOD policy should also ensure that the devices are appropriately backed up to prevent the loss of critical data under unforeseen circumstances.</li></ul><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The mobile management technology is effective only when suitable policies are established, implemented, and supported. The organizations must ensure sufficient security in the mobile ecosystem to make the BYOD programs work. This requires a thorough assessment of the operating environment and the development of a solution that provides the following.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Asset and identity management</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Local storage controls</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Removable media controls</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Network access levels</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Network application controls</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Corporate versus personal app controls</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Web and messaging security</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Device health management</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Data loss prevention</li></ul><p><strong>Support</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The inconsistent nature of BYOD users will increase the frequency of support calls. Therefore, organizations should establish suitable processes and capabilities in the early stages to ensure success. Mobile committees should frequently reassess the support levels and ensure the productivity of their mobile employees.</p></div>
