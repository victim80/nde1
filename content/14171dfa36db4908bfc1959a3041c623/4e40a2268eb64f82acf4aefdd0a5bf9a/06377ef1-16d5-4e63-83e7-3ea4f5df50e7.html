  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: center;">Figure 7.1: Standalone Architecture</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ad-hoc mode works effectively for a small group of devices and it is necessary to connect all the devices with each other in close proximity. The network performance degrades as the number of devices increases. It becomes cumbersome for a network administrator to manage the network in this mode, because devices connect and disconnect regularly. It is not possible to bridge this mode with a traditional wired network and it does not allow internet access until a special gateway is present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ad-hoc mode works better in a small area and does not require any access points (such as a router or a switch), thus minimizing the cost. This mode acts as a backup option and appears when there is a problem or a malfunction in the APs or a centrally coordinated network (infrastructure mode). This mode uses the functionality of each adaptor to enable security authentication and to use wireless services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The key characteristics of an ad-hoc wireless network are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The AP encrypts and decrypts text messages.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Each AP operates independently and has its own respective configuration files.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The network configuration remains constant with changes in the network conditions.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Infrastructure Network Topology (Centrally Coordinated Architecture/ Basic Service Set (BSS))</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A centrally coordinated architecture (infrastructure mode) or a basic service set (BSS) mode is an architecture where all wireless devices connect to each other through an AP. This AP (router or switch) receives Internet access by connecting to a broadband modem. This mode will work effectively when deployed in large organizations. It simplifies the network management and helps address the operational issues. It assures resiliency while allowing a number of systems to connect across the network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This mode provides enhanced security options, scalability, stability, and easy management. The downside is that it is expensive since an AP (router or switch) is required to connect the devices to each other.</p></div>
