This section discusses vulnerabilities, attacks and security challenges associated with containers. The section also explains vulnerabilities, attacks and security challenges associated with Docker and Kubernetes, which are widely used for developing, packaging, running, and managing applications and all their dependencies in the form of containers.</p></div>
