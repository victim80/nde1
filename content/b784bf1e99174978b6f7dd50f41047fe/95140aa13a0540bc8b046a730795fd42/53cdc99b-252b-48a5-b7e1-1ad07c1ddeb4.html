  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The use of mobile devices in work environments has changed the security approach of organizations. It has given rise to a new set of security risks and challenges in organizational security. In addition to the mobile device security risks that include weak security systems and insufficient configuration of mobile devices and platforms, enterprise mobile device security faces additional security challenges. Mobile devices are moving targets that can be used outside an organization and its security system, thereby defeating the purpose of preventing security attacks when organizations allow mobile devices at the workplace.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These challenges can be divided into the following categories:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This includes the loss or theft of a mobile device owing to their portability and lightweight. Attackers can perform malicious actions if they get physical access to a device such as flashing the device with a malicious system image that is connected to a computer to install a malicious application or conduct data extraction.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the devices should not be left unattended. Security measures such as device authentication and encryption must be enforced. Instead of using a simple password, enforce multiple forms of authentication to prevent unauthorized access to mobile devices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network-based Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Mobile devices that use common wireless network interfaces (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) for connectivity are vulnerable to wireless eavesdropping attempts.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, employees should connect to trusted networks using WPA21 or use secured network protocols (IPSec, SSL, SSH, HTTPS, Kerberos, etc.) to prevent mobile devices from network-based threats. Moreover, they can use special gateways with customized firewalls and security controls to direct the mobile traffic. For example, content filtering and data loss prevention tools.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>System-based Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Manufacturers may unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities in devices; for example, vulnerabilities in SwiftKey keyboards or mobile OSes. Therefore, the devices should be regularly updated to reduce threats.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Application-based Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Vendors may not release timely app updates and support for older OS versions or users may not update their apps regularly. Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in applications and attempt to steal data, download other malware, or control the device remotely, thereby resulting in financial loss and risk the reputation of an organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, strict controls must be enforced regarding downloading and installing applications on a device and using mobile anti-virus. Additionally, strong policies must be established to limit or block the use of third-party applications on devices.</p></div>
