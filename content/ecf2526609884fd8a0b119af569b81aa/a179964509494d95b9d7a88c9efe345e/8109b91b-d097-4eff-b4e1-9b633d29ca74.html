  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">RAID level 5 involves a block-interleaved distributed parity; it includes a block-level striping with a distributed parity. The parity information is distributed among all drives except one. The data chunks in a RAID level 5 system are larger than the regular I/O size, but they can be resized. To prevent data loss following a drive failure, data can be calculated from the distributed parity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The RAID 5 needs at least three disks; however, more than three disks can be used for a better performance. RAID 5 is not a good choice for write operations on the system. Rebuilding the RAID 5 array following a disk failure takes a long time. The performance can be degraded when the array is being rebuilt, making it vulnerable to additional disk failures. This level offers significantly better read performance as the disks independently process the data requests.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RAID 5 is most often found in file and application servers, database servers, along with web, email, and news servers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of RAID Level 5</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read data:</strong> Among all RAID levels, level 5 has the highest read data transaction rates.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Withstand failure</strong>: RAID 5 can withstand the failure of a single drive and is not affected by the loss of data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hot swapping:</strong> In case of a disk failure, the failed disk can be replaced with a new one, without a server shutdown.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of RAID Level 5</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Slow write operation:</strong> Servers built using RAID 5 suffer from performance issues with write operations, and these can eventually result in reduced speeds.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example:</strong> Employees accessing a database on a RAID 5 server will reduce the serverâ€™s production time.</p></div>
