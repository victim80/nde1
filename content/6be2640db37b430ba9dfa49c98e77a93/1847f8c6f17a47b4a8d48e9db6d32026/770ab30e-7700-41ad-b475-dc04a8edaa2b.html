  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Kubernetes enables an organization to automate application deployment, which leads to tremendous growth in business. However, these deployments are vulnerable to attacks and exploitation from adversaries. Thus, security is a critical component for all deployments of Kubernetes. Containerization in clouds can be targeted through attacks such as ransomware attacks, cryptomining, data stealing, and service disruption. The hyperdynamic nature of containers is responsible for the following Kubernetes security challenges.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explosion of East-West Traffic</strong>: Since containers are dynamically deployed in multiple hosts or clouds, east-west traffic (traffic flow within a data center) and internal traffic should be monitored for attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Increased Attack Surface</strong>: Every container has an attack surface and vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by an adversary. Further, container orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes also increase the attack surface of the container.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Automating Security to Keep Pace:&nbsp;</strong>Due to the dynamic nature and the constantly changing environment of the container, old models and security tools cannot provide complete protection. Therefore, there is a need to automate security for securing containers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Too many containers:</strong> Deploying numerous containers can make it more complex and difficult to maintain visibility and to scrutinize vulnerable or misconfigured containers, thereby causing elevated risk to the organization.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Communication between containers: </strong>Containers communicate with each other and with internal and external endpoints for proper functioning. However, if a container is exploited, all the other connected containers in the environment can also be breached.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Default configuration settings:</strong> Using the default settings in Kubernetes makes application development faster and helps in easy communication with all the components in the Kubernetes environment. However, using the default settings can also make Kubernetes more vulnerable and less secure.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Runtime security challenges:</strong> The transient and fast nature of the container makes it difficult for an individual to monitor which container process is currently running. Hence, it also makes it more complex to detect any running malicious process.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compliance issues: </strong>Organizations should follow the techniques to ensure that the Kubernetes environment adheres to the security controls, industry standards, and internal organizational policies that were devised for conventional application architectures.</li></ul></div>
