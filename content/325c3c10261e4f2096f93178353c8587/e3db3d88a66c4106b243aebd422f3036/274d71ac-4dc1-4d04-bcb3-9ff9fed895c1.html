  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS is also classified as a <strong>centralized IDS&nbsp;</strong>or a <strong>distributed IDS</strong>, this classification is based on the structure of the IDS</p><h3>Distributed Structure of an IDS</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">A distributed intrusion detection system (dIDS) consists of multiple IDSs over a large network. These systems communicate with each other or with a central server that facilitates an advanced network of monitoring, incident analysis, and instant attack data. By having these cooperative agents distributed across a network, network operators can get a broader view of what is occurring on their network as a whole.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">dIDS also allows a company to efficiently manage its incident analysis resources by centralizing its attack records and by giving the analyst a way to spot new trends or patterns and identify threats to the network across multiple network segments.</p></div>
