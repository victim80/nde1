  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p>Discussed below are the various VPN-related security risks.</p><p><strong>VPN Fingerprinting</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The VPN fingerprinting technique allows the attacker to access useful information such as the type of connections implemented, devices used, and OSes deployed. Some systems, such as Cisco PIX and Nortel Contivity, potentially reveal crucial data such as the general type of devices deployed for building the network, while other systems display software version details.</p><p><strong>Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Certain security issues occur if the credentials are not stored and protected appropriately. These security issues are due to an insecure method of storing authentication credentials by VPN clients.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are common VPN issues with authentication and credentials:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Storing the username unencrypted in a file or a registry</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Storing the password in a scrambled form</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Storing credentials in plaintext in memory</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Weak registry or file permissions for stored credentials</li></ul><p><strong>Username Enumeration Vulnerabilities</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Many remote-access VPNs use the IKE aggressive mode with a pre-shared key authentication method. The client sends an IKE packet to the VPN server, which responds using another IKE packet. These packets contain several payloads; the identity payload contains the username, and the hash payload contains the password.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An attacker can confirm the difference between valid and invalid usernames from their computational differences. Furthermore, an attacker can guess the correct password using the IKE aggressive mode and easily uncover the hash from the VPN server. This hash can be used with a brute-force attack to obtain the password.</p><p><strong>Ofﬂine Password Cracking</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Offline password cracking is one of the most common flaws of a VPN. An attacker can crack a password offline by gaining access to the password hashes. Once the attacker obtains the user credentials, they can easily gain hash access from the VPN server. Simple passwords containing simple words can increase the frequency of password cracking.</p><p><strong>Man-in-the-middle Attacks</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Attackers may use insecure authentication protocols such as IKE to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on a VPN. In this type of attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between the client and server and obtains the client’s authentication to the server. Man-in-the-middle attacks occur during data transfer through the VPN and allow an attacker to intercept, insert, delete, and modify messages; reflect messages back to the sender; replay old messages; and redirect messages.</p><p><strong>Lack of Account Lockout</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The main aim of using the account lockout feature is to restrict the number of login attempts to a certain limit. If a user keeps attempting to login beyond the limit, the account is automatically locked out. This feature prevents password cracking attacks such as brute forcing and dictionary attacks. Attackers can take advantage of the lack of an account lockout feature to gain account credentials, and the lack of such a feature reduces the security of the account.</p><p><strong>Poor Default Configurations</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Almost all organizations have an automated configuration setup. However, if the organization uses the default configuration for the VPN, attackers may exploit these default configurations to compromise the security of the VPN. The default configurations support many ciphers and modes, ESP, and AH. An attacker with access to the client machine can prompt the end user to use a weaker cipher, which will make the attack easier. The end user may not notice that the cipher and configuration was changed, because the VPN will continue to function normally.</p><p><strong>Poor Guidance and Documentation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Poor guidance can lead to security vulnerabilities in the configuration and implementation of a VPN. An incorrect implementation provides an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the VPN.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are situations where this guidance is required:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Using weak ciphers such as export-grade or single DES, which can be cracked easily</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Using weak key authentication techniques such as a pre-shared key with the IKE aggressive mode, which sends the username and vulnerable offline password to crack if a valid username is identified</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Choosing the AH protocol, which does not encrypt VPN traffic</li></ul></div>
