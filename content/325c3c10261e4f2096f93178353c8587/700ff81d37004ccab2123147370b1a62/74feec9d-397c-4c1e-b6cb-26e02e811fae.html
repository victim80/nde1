  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Before effectively deploying an IDS, security professionals must understand their network infrastructure and organizational security policies. Then, plan for a staged IDS deployment in the network. A staged deployment will help you gain experience and discover how much monitoring and maintenance of network resources is actually required. The monitoring and maintenance of network resources varies depending on the size of an organization’s network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The organization should consider a staged deployment of an IDS. The initial deployment of an IDS requires high maintenance. Then the organization can think of implementing an IDS at the next stage. The staged deployment helps the organization discover exactly where it needs security from the IDS. Implementing an IDS across the organization’s network is advisable when the personnel are able to handle the IDS alerts from different sensors placed at various places. Staged deployment provides administrators enough time to think and get used to the new technology. This staged approach is beneficial to those evaluating and investigating IDS alerts and IDS logs.</p></div>
