  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) was announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance on January 2018 as an advanced implementation of WPA2 that provides trailblazing protocols. Like WPA2, the WPA3 protocol has two variants: WPA3-Personal and WPA3-Enterprise.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">WPA3 provides cutting-edge features to simplify Wi-Fi security and provides the capabilities necessary to support different network deployments ranging from corporate networks to home networks. It also ensures cryptographic consistency using encryption algorithms such as AES and TKIP to defend against network attacks. Furthermore, it provides network resilience through Protected Management Frames (PMF) that deliver a high level of protection against eavesdropping and forging attacks. WPA3 also disallows outdated legacy protocols.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Modes of Operation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">WPA3 offers two modes of operation:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WPA3-Personal</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This mode is mainly used to deliver password-based authentication. WPA3 is more rigid to attacks than WPA2 because it uses a modern key establishment protocol called the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly Key Exchange, which replaces the PSK concept used in WPA2-Personal. Some of the features of WPA3-Personal are described below.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resistance to offline dictionary attacks: </strong>It prevents passive password attacks such as brute-forcing.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resistance to key recovery:</strong> Even when a password is determined, it is impossible to capture and determine session keys while maintaining the forward secrecy of network traffic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Natural password choice</strong>: It allows users to choose weak or popular phrases as passwords, which are easy to remember.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Easy accessibility</strong>: It can provide greater protection than WPA2 without changing the previous methods used by users for connecting to a network.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WPA3-Enterprise</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This mode is based on WPA2. &nbsp;It offers better security than WPA2 across the network and protects sensitive data using many cryptographic concepts and tools. Some of the security protocols used by WPA3-Enterprise are described below.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Authenticated encryption</strong>: It helps in maintaining the authenticity and confidentiality of data. For this purpose, WPA3 uses the 256-bit Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP-256).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key derivation and validation</strong>: It helps in generating a cryptographic key from a password or master key. It uses the 384-bit hashed message authentication mode (HMAC) with the Secure Hash Algorithm, termed HMAC-SHA-384.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key establishment and verification</strong>: It helps in exchanging cryptographic keys among two parties. For this purpose, WPA3 uses Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) using a 384-bit elliptic curve.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frame protection and robust administration</strong>: WPA3 uses 256-bit Broadcast/Multicast Integrity Protocol Galois Message Authentication Code (BIP-GMAC-256) for this purpose.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Enhancements in WPA3 with Respect to WPA2</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">WPA3 can be used to implement a layered security strategy that can protect all aspects of a Wi-Fi network. WPA3 has a certification program that specifies the prevailing standards the product must support. The Dragonfly handshake/SAE protocol is mandatory for WPA3 certification.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The important features of WPA3 are as follows.</p><ol><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secured handshake</strong>: The Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) protocol, also known as the Dragonfly handshake, can be used to make a password resistant to dictionary and brute-force attacks, preventing the offline decryption of data.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wi-Fi Easy Connect</strong>: This feature simplifies the security configuration process by managing different interface connections in a network with one interface using the Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP). This can securely allow a plethora of smart devices in a network to connect to one device using a quick response (QR) code or password. It also helps set up a connection between different IoT devices.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Unauthenticated encryption</strong>: It uses a new feature called Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) that replaces the 802.11 “open” authentication by providing better protection when using public hotspots and public networks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bigger session keys</strong>: The cryptographic security process of WPA3-Enterprise supports key sizes of 192 bits or higher, which are difficult to crack, ensuring rigid protection.</li></ol></div>
