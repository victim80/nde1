  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The advanced encryption standard (AES) is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specification for the encryption of electronic data. It also helps to encrypt digital information such as telecommunications, financial, and government data. US government agencies have been using it to secure sensitive but unclassified material.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An AES consists of a symmetric-key algorithm in which the encryption as well as decryption is performed using the same key. It is an iterated block cipher that works by repeating the defined steps multiple times. It has a 128-bit block size, having key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits respectively for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. The design of AES makes its use efficient in both software and hardware. It works at multiple network layers simultaneously.</p></div>
