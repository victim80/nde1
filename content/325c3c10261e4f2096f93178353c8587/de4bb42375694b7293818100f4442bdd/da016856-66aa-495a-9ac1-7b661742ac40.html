To meet strict compliance requirements and for threat identification and mitigation, organizations must audit the information passing through their enterprise network. Security incident and event management (SIEM) systems are used to manage and store a huge collection of log data from different sources such as networks, applications, devices, security, and user activity in real time. SIEM performs the real-time monitoring and detection of security events, forensic and post-incident analysis, auditing, and IT security and regulatory compliance reporting. Thus, SIEM is highly important in network security.</p></div>
