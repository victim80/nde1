Non-transparent proxies are difficult to configure, as each client program must be set up to route all requests to a single port. However, these proxies provide a greater level of security than other types. A non-transparent proxy is one that modifies a request or response, and the client is made aware of the proxyâ€™s existence. The entire requested URL is sent to the proxy that has the host name. It provides added services to the user agent such as group annotation services, media-type transformation, protocol reduction, and anonymity filtering.</p></div>
