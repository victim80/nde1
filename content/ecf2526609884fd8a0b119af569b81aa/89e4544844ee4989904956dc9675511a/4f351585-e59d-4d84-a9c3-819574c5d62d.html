  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations can choose any backup method depending on their budget and IT infrastructure. The different types of data backup methods are:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hot Backup</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A hot backup is a popular backup method. It is also called as dynamic backup or active backup. In a hot backup, the system continues to perform the backup even when the user is accessing the system. Implementation of a hot backup in an organization avoids downtime. However, changes made to the data during the backup process is not reflected in the final backup file. In addition, while the backup is in process, the users may find the system to be slow. A hot backup is an expensive process. It is used when a service level down time is not allowed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Immediate data backup switch over is possible</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Very expensive</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cold Backup</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A cold backup is also called an offline backup. A cold backup can take place when the system is not working or is not accessible by users. A cold backup is the safest backup method as it avoids the risk of copying the data. A cold backup involves downtime as the users cannot use the machine until the process is back online. A cold backup is not as expensive as a hot backup. It is used when a service level down time is allowed and a full backup is required.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Least expensive</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Switching over the data backup requires additional time</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Warm Backup</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A warm backup is also called a nearline backup. It will have a connectivity to the network. In a warm backup, the system updates are turned on to receive periodic updates. It is beneficial when mirroring or duplicating the data. The warm backup process can take a long time and can be conducted in intervals that can last from days to weeks. It is a combination of both hot and cold backups.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Less expensive than a hot backup</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Switching over the data backup takes less time than a cold backup but more time than a hot backup</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It is less accessible than hot backup</li></ul></div>
