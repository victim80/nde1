  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;">Modern IT environments use server virtualization, network virtualization, storage virtualization, and desktop virtualization for fast provisioning of network environments and to keep pace with modern technologies. Virtualization has been changing security concepts in modern IT environments, as the various security challenges associated with virtualization are unique and distinct from those of conventional environments.</p><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;">Cloud computing is an emerging technology that delivers computing services such as online business applications, online data storage, and webmail over the Internet. Cloud implementation enables a distributed workforce, reduces organization expenses, provides data security, etc. Because of these benefits, many business organizations have recently been migrating their data and infrastructure to the cloud. However, the cloud environment also poses many threats and risks to organizations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:baseline;">This module discusses virtualization concepts and technologies such as network virtualization, software-defined networks, and network function virtualization, as well as their security. This module also explains the various aspects of enterprise cloud security that are important for an organization to securely store or process data on the cloud. Furthermore, this module discusses various elements of cloud security, such as user identity and access management (IAM), encryption and key management, application-level security, data storage security, monitoring, logging, and compliance to secure sensitive data on the cloud.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of this module, you will be able to do the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand virtualization, its components, and virtualization enablers</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand OS virtualization security and concerns</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand the best practices for OS virtualization security</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Explain cloud computing and its benefits</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand different types of cloud computing services</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Explain cloud deployment models</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Understand importance of cloud security and its best practices</li></ul></div>
