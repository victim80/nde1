  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Analysis timing refers to the elapsed time between the occurrence of events and analysis of those events. Based on analysis timing, an IDS can be classified into two distinct types: interval-based IDS and real-time–based IDS.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Interval-based IDS</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">Interval-based or offline analysis refers to the storage of the intrusion-related information for further analysis. This type of IDS checks the status and content of log files at predefined intervals. The information about an intrusion detection does not flow continuously from monitoring points to analysis engines, it is simply stored and forwarded. It performs analysis of the detected intrusion offline. Interval-based IDSs are prohibited from performing an active response. Batch mode was common in early IDS implementations because their capabilities did not support real-time data acquisition and analysis.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Real-time–based IDS</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">The information about an intrusion detection flows continuously from monitoring points to analysis engines. It performs analysis of the detected intrusion on the fly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A real-time–based IDS is designed for on-the-fly processing and is the most common approach for a network-based IDS. It operates on a continuous information feed. Real-time–based IDS gathers and monitors information from network traffic streams regularly. The detection performed by this IDS yields results quick enough to allow the IDS system to take action affecting the progress of the detected attack. It can also conduct online verification of events with the help of on-the-fly processing and respond to them simultaneously. An IDS using this type of processing requires more RAM and a large hard drive because of the high data storage required to trace all of the network packets online.</p></div>
