  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations are opting for IoT-enabled environments because IoT devices work on a three-dimensional plane and provide connectivity for anyone at any time, for anything, and from any place. IoT devices facilitate connection to various objects; examples include Human-to-Thing (H2T) interactions using generic equipment, Thing-to-Thing (T2T) interactions between PCs, and Human-to-Human (H2H) interactions without using a PC. The user can connect to IoT devices at any place regardless of whether they are on the move, indoor (away from PC), outdoor, or at the PC. The working mechanism of IoT devices on the three-dimensional plane allows the user to continuously monitor their business, resolve concerns instantly, increase the efficiency of the business, enhance the growth of the organization, increase security, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Some key features of IoT are connectivity, sensors, artificial intelligence, small devices, and active engagement. IoT technology includes four primary systems: IoT devices, gateway systems, data storage systems based on the cloud, and remote control using mobile apps. These systems together enable communication between two endpoints. Discussed below are some of the important components of IoT technology that play an essential role in the working of an IoT device.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sensing technology</strong>: Sensors embedded in devices acquire a wide variety of information from the surroundings such as the temperature, gases, location, working of industrial machines, and health data of a patient.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IoT gateways</strong>: Gateways are used to bridge the gap between an IoT device (internal network) and the end user (external network), thereby allowing them to connect and communicate with each other. The data collected by the sensors in IoT devices are collected and sent to the concerned user or cloud through the gateway.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud server/data storage</strong>: The collected data, after traveling through the gateway, arrives at the cloud, where it is stored and subjected to data analysis. The processed data is then transmitted to the user, who takes actions based on the information received.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Remote control using mobile apps</strong>: The end user utilizes remote control devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops installed with a mobile app to monitor, control, retrieve data from, and take actions on IoT devices from a remote location.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example:</strong></p><ol><li style="text-align: justify;">A smart security system is integrated with a gateway, which in turn helps connect the device to the Internet and cloud infrastructure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The data storage in the cloud includes the information of every device connected to the network. The information includes the device IDs, the present status of the devices, who accessed the devices, and how many times they accessed the devices. It also includes information such as for how long the device was accessed the last time.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The connection with the cloud server is established through web services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The user on the other side, who has the required app to access a device remotely on their mobile phone, interacts with the app and, in turn, with the device. Before accessing the device, they are asked to authenticate themselves. If the submitted credentials match those saved in the cloud, the user obtains access. Otherwise, access is denied, ensuring security. The cloud server identifies the device’s ID and sends a request associated with that device using gateways.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the security system recording footage senses any unusual activity, then it sends an alert to the cloud through the gateway, which matches the device’s ID and the user associated with it. Finally, the end user receives an alert.</li></ol></div>
