  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The IEEE standards correspond to the various wireless networking transmission methods. They are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11 (Wi-Fi):</strong> This standard corresponds to WLANs and uses FHSS or DSSS as the frequency hopping spectrum. It allows an electronic device to connect to the internet using a wireless connection that is established in any network. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11a: </strong>This standard is the second extension to the original 802.11 standard. It operates in the 5 GHz frequency band and supports a bandwidth of up to 54 Mbps by using OFDM. It has a fast maximum speed but is more sensitive to walls and other obstacles.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11b: </strong>IEEE expanded the 802.11 standard by creating the 802.11b specifications in 1999. This standard operates in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band and supports a bandwidth of up to 11 Mbps by using DSSS modulation.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11d:</strong> This standard is an enhanced version of the 802.11a and 802.11b standards. It supports the regulatory domains. The particulars of this standard can be set at the media access control (MAC) layer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11e:&nbsp;</strong>This standard defines the quality of service (QoS) for wireless applications. The enhanced service is modified using the MAC layer. This standard maintains the quality of video and audio streaming, real-time online applications, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11g:</strong> This standard is an extension of the 802.11 standard. It supports a maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps using the OFDM technology and uses the same 2.4 GHz band as 802.11b. It is compatible with the 802.11b standard, which implies that 802.11b devices can work directly with an 802.11g access point.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11i: </strong>This standard is used as a standard for WLANs and provides improved encryption for networks. 802.11i requires new protocols such as TKIP and advanced encryption standard (AES).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11n:</strong> This standard was developed in 2009. It aims to improve the 802.11g standard in terms of the bandwidth. It operates on both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and supports a maximum data rate up to 300 Mbps. It uses multiple transmitters and receiver antennas (MIMO) to allow a maximum data rate along with security improvements.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11ac:</strong> This standard provides a high throughput network at the frequency of 5 GHz. It is faster and more reliable than the 802.11n standard. It involves gigabit networking which provides an instantaneous data transfer experience.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11ax:</strong> 802.11ax also known as Wi-Fi 6. It is the sixth generation of the Wi-Fi standard. It is designed to operate in all ISM bands between 1 and 6 GHz.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.11ad</strong>: 802.11ad involves the inclusion of a new physical layer for 802.11 networks. This standard works on the 60 GHz spectrum. The data propagation speed in this standard is significantly different from the bands operating at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. With a very high frequency spectrum, the transfer speed is much higher than that of 802.11n.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.12</strong>: This standard dominates media utilization by working on the demand priority protocol. Based on this standard, the ethernet speed increases to 100 Mbps. It is compatible with the 802.3 and 802.5 standards. Users currently on these standards can directly upgrade to the 802.12 standard.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.15</strong>: This defines the standards for a wireless personal area network (WPAN). It describes the specification for wireless connectivity with fixed or portable devices.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.15.1 (Bluetooth): </strong>Bluetooth is mainly used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.15.4 (Zigbee)</strong>: The 802.15.4 standard has a low data rate and complexity. Zigbee is the specification used in the 802.15.4 standard. It transmits long distance data through a mesh network. This specification handles applications operating at a low data rate, but longer battery life. Its data rate is 250 kbits/s.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>802.15.5</strong>: This standard deploys itself on a full mesh or a half mesh topology. It includes network initialization, addressing, and unicasting.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IEEE 802.16</strong>: This standard is also known as WiMAX and is a specification for fixed broadband wireless metropolitan access networks (MANs) that use a point-to-multipoint architecture.</li></ul></div>
