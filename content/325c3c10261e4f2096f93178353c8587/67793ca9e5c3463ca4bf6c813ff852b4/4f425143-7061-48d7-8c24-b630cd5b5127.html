  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Network segmentation is the practice of splitting a network into smaller network segments, separating groups of systems or applications from each other. Whether it is a physical or virtual network segmentation, both can restrict communication throughout a network and also restrict network attacks. In a segmented network, groups of systems or applications that have no interaction with each other are placed on different network segments. Even if an attacker/an insider manages to penetrate the perimeter security, they cannot access the network resources from one segment to another.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Network segmentation overcomes the drawback of a traditional flat network where all the network resources (servers, workstations, etc.) are placed on the same network. If an attacker manages to penetrate through the perimeter defense, they can see and have an easy access to a flat network, since most detective tools focus on what is going outside a network. Though it is easy to manage a flat network infrastructure, it is always open to various attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security benefits of network segmentation</strong>:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved security</strong>: It isolates network traffic to prevent access between network segments.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better access control</strong>: It allows accessing specific network resources.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved monitoring</strong>: It provides event logging, monitoring, and denying internal connections, and detecting malicious actions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved performance</strong>: It reduces local traffic, with fewer hosts per subnet, and isolates broadcast traffic to the local subnet.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better containment</strong>: It limits any network issues that might occur to the local subnet.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Working Principle of Network Segmentation</strong></p></div>
