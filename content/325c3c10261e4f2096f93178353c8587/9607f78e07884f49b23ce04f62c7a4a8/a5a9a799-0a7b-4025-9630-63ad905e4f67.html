  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Deploying a host-based IDS provides an additional layer of security. This type of IDS must be installed and configured on each critical system in the network. You should consider installing a host-based IDS on every host in the organization. When deploying a host-based IDS, it is recommended that it has centralized management and reporting functions, which reduces the complexity for managing alerts from a large number of hosts.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Host-based IDS (HIDS) deployment is done with proper planning and care, as deploying these on a large-scale environment has the potential to generate numerous false alarms, which can get quite difficult to manage. Initial deployment of a HIDS is done on critical servers only. Security professionals must consider implementing an IDS management console before adding additional hosts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If security professional comfortably manages the HIDS on critical servers at the initial stage, then and only then they can consider deploying the HIDS on all remaining hosts in the network. This allows security professional to provide security at the individual host level. However, deploying HIDS on every host on the network is quite expensive and requires additional software and maintenance, especially in case of a wide-scale HIDS deployment.</p></div>
