  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a wireless network, data are transmitted through EM waves that carry signals over the communication path. Terms associated with wireless networks include the following:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)</strong>: It is a universal system used for mobile data transmission in wireless networks worldwide.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> It describes the amount of information that may be broadcast over a connection. Usually, bandwidth refers to the data transfer rate and is measured in bits (amount of data) per second (bps).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Access point (AP)</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>An AP is used to connect wireless devices to a wireless/wired network. It allows wireless communication devices to connect to a wireless network through wireless standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. It serves as a switch or hub between a wired LAN and wireless network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Basic service set identifier (BSSID): </strong>It is the media access control (MAC) address of an access point (AP) or base station that has set up a basic service set (BSS). Generally, users are unaware of the BSS to which they belong. When a user moves a device, the BSS used by the device could change because of a variation in the range covered by the AP, but this change may not affect the connectivity of the wireless device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band:</strong> This band is a set of frequencies used by the international industrial, scientific, and medical communities.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hotspot</strong>: These are places where wireless networks are available for public use. Hotspots refer to areas with Wi-Fi availability, where users can enable Wi-Fi on their devices and connect to the Internet.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Association</strong>: It refers to the process of connecting a wireless device to an AP.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Service set identifier (SSID)</strong>: An SSID is a 32-alphanumeric-character unique identifier given to a wireless local area network (WLAN) that acts as a wireless identifier of the network. The SSID permits connections to the desired network among available independent networks. Devices connecting to the same WLAN should use the same SSID to establish connections.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM):</strong> An OFDM is a method of digital modulation of data in which a signal, at a chosen frequency, is split into multiple carrier frequencies that are orthogonal (occurring at right angles) to each other. OFDM maps information on the changes in the carrier phase, frequency, amplitude, or a combination of these and shares bandwidth with other independent channels. It produces a transmission scheme that supports higher bit rates than parallel channel operation. It is also a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiple input, multiple output-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM):</strong> MIMO-OFDM influences the spectral efficiency of 4G and 5G wireless communication services. Adopting the MIMO-OFDM technique reduces interference and increases the channel robustness.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS):</strong> DSSS is a spread spectrum technique that multiplies the original data signal with a pseudo-random noise-spreading code. Also referred to as a data transmission scheme or modulation scheme, the technique protects signals against interference or jamming.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS):</strong> FHSS, also known as frequency-hopping code-division multiple access (FH-CDMA), is a method of transmitting radio signals by rapidly switching a carrier among many frequency channels. It decreases the efficiency of unauthorized interception or jamming of telecommunications. In FHSS, a transmitter hops between available frequencies using a specified algorithm in a pseudorandom sequence known to both the sender and receiver.</li></ul></div>
