  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 10.6: Classification of ciphers</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Ciphers are of two main types: classical and modern.</p><h4><strong>Classical Ciphers</strong></h4><p>Classical ciphers are the most basic type of ciphers, which operate on letters of the alphabet (A–Z). These ciphers are generally implemented either by hand or with simple mechanical devices. Because these ciphers are easily deciphered, they are generally unreliable.</p><p><strong>Types of classical ciphers</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Substitution cipher</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The user replaces units of plaintext with ciphertext according to a regular system. The units may be single letters, pairs of letters, or combinations of them, and so on. The recipient performs inverse substitution to decipher the text. Examples include the Beale cipher, autokey cipher, Gronsfeld cipher, and Hill cipher.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, “<strong>HELLO WORLD</strong>” can be encrypted as “<strong>PSTER HGFST</strong>” (i.e., H=P, E=S, etc.).</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transposition cipher</strong>: Here, letters in the plaintext are rearranged according to a regular system to produce the ciphertext. For example, “<strong>CRYPTOGRAPHY</strong>” when encrypted becomes “<strong>AOYCRGPTYRHP</strong>.” Examples include the rail fence cipher, route cipher, and Myszkowski transposition.</p><h4><strong>Modern Ciphers</strong></h4><p>Modern ciphers are designed to withstand a wide range of attacks. They provide message secrecy, integrity, and authentication of the sender. A user can calculate a modern cipher using a one-way mathematical function that is capable of factoring large prime numbers.</p><p><strong>Types of Modern ciphers</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Based on the type of key used</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Symmetric-key algorithms (Private-key cryptography)</strong>: Use the same key for encryption and decryption.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Asymmetric-key algorithms (Public-key cryptography)</strong>: Use two different keys for encryption and decryption.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Based on the type of input data</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Block cipher</strong>: Deterministic algorithms operating on a block (a group of bits) of fixed size with an unvarying transformation specified by a symmetric key. Most modern ciphers are block ciphers. They are widely used to encrypt bulk data. Examples include DES, AES, IDEA, etc. When the block size is less than that used by the cipher, padding is employed to achieve a fixed block size.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stream cipher</strong>: Symmetric-key ciphers are plaintext digits combined with a key stream (pseudorandom cipher digit stream). Here, the user applies the key to each bit, one at a time. Examples include RC4, SEAL, etc.</li></ul></div>
