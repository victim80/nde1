  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A typical RAID 1 contains an exact copy of the data on two or more disks. RAID 1 writes data on multiple drives and multiple mirror drives at the same time. The failure of one drive does not affect the data on other drives. This allows data retrieval from the mirror drive. Similar to RAID 0, RAID 1 provides no parity, stripping, or spanning of disk space across multiple disks. RAID 1 can be used in accounting, payroll, and other financial applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">RAID 1 is suitable in environments where read performance matters more than write performance. RAID 1 has improved read performance because the data in a disk can be read at the same time simultaneously.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">RAID level 1 provides data reliability in case of a disk failure as it can still provide access to the same data mirrored on other disks. In a RAID 1 hardware implementation, a minimum of two disks are required. In a software RAID 1, data can be copied to a disk volume. RAID 1 reduces the total disk capacity by half.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: If a RAID 1 server is configured with two 4 TB drives, the storage capacity will be 4 TB and not 8 TB.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The drive that accesses the data first will service the request. The write throughput in RAID 1 is always slower because every drive needs to be updated. Thus, its performance is limited by the slowest drive. It is only as fast as its slowest drive. RAID 1 will continue to function as long as there is at least one working drive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of RAID Level 1</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High read performance:</strong> Because there are two disks, the read performance is higher in a RAID level 1 system. Data can be read simultaneously while being written on the other disk. Thus, the redundancy is excellent.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compatibility:</strong> RAID 1 is compatible with hardware and software RAID systems, including controllers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reliability:</strong> The mirroring feature in a RAID 1 ensures the data will be available, making it more reliable than a RAID level 0.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of RAID Level 1</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>RAID level 1 undergoes duplexing, which needs twice the amount of disk space for storage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hot swapping unavailable:</strong> If a disk fails to run, it cannot be replaced while the server is still in operation. This is called hot swapping. RAID level 1 does not support hot swapping.</li></ul></div>
