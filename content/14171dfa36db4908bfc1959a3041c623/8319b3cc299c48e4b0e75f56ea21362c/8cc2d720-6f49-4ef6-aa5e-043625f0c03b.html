  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Methods used to perform Wi-Fi authentication include open system authentication and shared key authentication.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Open system authentication process</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Open system authentication is a null authentication algorithm that does not verify whether it is a user or a machine requesting network access. It uses cleartext transmission to allow the device to associate with an AP. In the absence of encryption, the device can use the SSID of an available WLAN to gain access to a wireless network. The enabled WEP key on the AP acts as an access control to enter the network. Any user entering the wrong WEP key cannot transmit messages via the AP even if the authentication is successful. The device can only transmit messages when its WEP key matches with the WEP key of the AP. This authentication mechanism does not depend on a RADIUS server on the network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the open system authentication process, any wireless client that wishes to access a Wi-Fi network sends a request to the wireless AP for authentication. In this process, the station sends an authentication management frame containing the identity of the sending station for authenticating and connecting with the other wireless stations. The AP then returns an authentication frame to confirm access to the requested station and completes the authentication process.</p></div>
