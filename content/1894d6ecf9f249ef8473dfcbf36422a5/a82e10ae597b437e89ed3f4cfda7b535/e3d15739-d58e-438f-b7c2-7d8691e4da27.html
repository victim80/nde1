Contraband refers to illegal materials such as explosives, bombs, and weapons, which should be banned from the premises. An attempt to enter the premises with contraband can be considered an act of terrorism. Contraband detection devices are able to detect such substances, even when they are covered by other objects.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Different types of devices are used to detect contraband materials; examples are handheld metal detectors, walkthrough metal detectors, and X-ray inspection systems.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Walkthrough metal detectors are mainly used in airport terminals, schools, sports stadiums, etc. They help check people who have admission to certain areas. Furthermore, walkthrough detectors should be maintained and properly monitored. They should be deployed at each entry point of the organization.</li></ul></div>
