  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An application-level proxy works as a proxy server and filters connections for specific services. It filters connections based on the services and protocols. For example, an FTP proxy will only allow FTP traffic to pass through, while all other services and protocols will be blocked.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is a type of server that acts as an interface between the user workstation and the Internet. It correlates with the gateway server and separates the enterprise network from the Internet. It receives requests from users for services and responds to the original requests only. A proxy service is an application or program that helps forward user requests (for example, FTP or Telnet) to the actual services. Proxies are also called application-level gateways as they renew the connections and act as a gateway to the services. Proxies run on a firewall host that is either a dual-homed host or some other bastion host for security purposes. Some proxies, named caching proxies, run for the purpose of network efficiency. They keep copies of the requested data of the hosts they proxy. Such proxies can provide the data directly when multiple hosts request the same data. Caching proxies help in reducing load on network connections whereas proxy servers provide both security and caching.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A proxy service is available between a user on an internal network and a service on an outside network (Internet) and is transparent. Instead of direct communication between each, they talk with the proxy and it handles all the communication between user and the Internet service. Transparency is the key advantage when using proxy services. To the user, a proxy server presents the illusion that they are dealing directly with the real server whereas the real server thinks that it is dealing directly with the user.</p></div>
