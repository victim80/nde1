Security professionals should decide the scope, implementation, and deployment of the VPN and perform continuous network monitoring to ensure the security of a VPN. They should be continuously aware of the overall architecture and scope of the VPN.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Protocols Used in Deploying a VPN</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To deploy VPNs, there are two primary options: IPsec and SSL. Each protocol has its own unique advantages and is utilized depending on the requirement of the user or the organization’s IT processes.</p><p><strong>IPsec VPN</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">IPsec-based VPN is the deployment solution most commonly used by organizations. It is a set of protocols and standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for secure communication on the IP layer. It ensures the security of each packet in communication by encrypting and authenticating them. IPsec connections are established using pre-installed VPN client software, which mainly focuses on company-managed desktops.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">IPsec VPNs can support all IP-based applications through an IPsec VPN product.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">They offer tremendous versatility and customizability through the modification of the VPN client software.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Organizations can control the VPN client functions by using the APIs in IPsec client software.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">They ensure the secure exchange of IP packets between remote networks or hosts and an IPsec gateway located at the edge of the organization’s private network.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The three basic applications of IPsec VPNs (associated with business requirements) are as follows.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Remote-access VPNs</strong>: These allow individual users, such as telecommuters, to connect to a corporate network. This application creates an L2TP/PPTP session protected by IPsec encryption.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Intranet VPNs</strong>: These help in connecting branch offices to the corporate headquarters, creating a transparent intranet.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Extranet VPNs</strong>: These allow companies to connect with their business partners (for example, suppliers, customers, and joint ventures).</li></ul><p><strong>SSL VPN (Web-based)</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">SSL-based VPNs provide remote-access connectivity using a web browser and its native SSL encryption, irrespective of the location. SSL does not require any special client software to be pre-installed and is capable of any type of connectivity. The connectivity ranges from company-managed desktops to non-company-managed desktops, such as employee-owned PCs, contractor-owned PCs, or business partner desktops. It helps in reducing desktop software maintenance as it downloads software dynamically whenever needed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">It offers additional features such as easy connectivity from non-company-managed desktops and requires little or no desktop software maintenance.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">It provides accessibility to the SSL library and access to TCP port 443.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">It works wherever the user can gain access to HTTPS websites such as Internet banking, secure webmail, or intranet sites.</li></ul></div>
