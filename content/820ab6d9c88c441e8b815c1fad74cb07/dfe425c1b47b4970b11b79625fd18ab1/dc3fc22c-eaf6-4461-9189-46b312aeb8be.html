This gateway device could be a smartphone or a hub that is acting as an intermediate point, which also provides security features and data or protocol translation. The protocols generally used in this mode of communication are ZigBee and Z-Wave.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the application layer gateway is a smartphone, then it might take the form of an app that interacts with the IoT device and with the cloud. This device might be a smart TV that connects to the cloud service through a mobile phone app.</p></div>
