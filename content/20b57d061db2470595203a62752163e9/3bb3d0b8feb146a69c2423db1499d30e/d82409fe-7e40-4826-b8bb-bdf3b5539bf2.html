  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Digital certificates allow a secure exchange of information between a sender and a receiver. This enables the use of a public key by the sender to the receiver. A trusted intermediary solution is used for securing the public keys, where the public key is bound with the name of its owner. Owners of the public key need to acquire their public keys certified from the intermediary; the intermediary then issues certificates called digital certificates to the owners, which they can use to send the public key to a number of users.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The sender applies for a digital certificate from the certificate authority (CA). Along with the encrypted message and the public key, the CA provides other identity validating information. The receiver accepts the encrypted message and uses the CA’s public key to decode the digital certificate. This allows the receiver to identify the digital signature and obtain the sender’s public key and other identification details.</p></div>
