  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The selection of an appropriate VPN depends on many factors such as cost, protocols, and technical issues. The following are a few factors to consider while selecting a VPN.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Compatibility</strong>: The organization should consider the compatibility of the selected VPN within the organizationâ€™s network and determine whether it is possible to adopt the selected VPN. Selecting and implementing a VPN that is not compatible will add extra expenditure and cause security issues.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Scalability</strong>: Increasing the number of employees working for an organization is a common trend. As the number of employees increases, the configured VPN needs to accommodate the new employees. The inability to handle an increasing number of users adversely affects the performance of the network. The organization must select a VPN that can handle any number of users at any time without affecting the performance of the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security</strong>: Security is an important factor while selecting a VPN. The following are the two major criteria in selecting a VPN.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Authentication</strong>: Organizations need to select an appropriate authentication method depending on the type of network on which the VPN is implemented.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Encryption</strong>: Organizations should be highly alert regarding the encryption process for the selected VPN. Some VPNs do not provide direct encryption, allowing attackers to gain information from the network.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Capacity</strong>: Organizations need to foresee the number of users joining it in the future and then select the VPN accordingly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cost</strong>: An organization should consider cost as a factor while selecting VPNs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Need</strong>: The need for a VPN depends on the requirements of an organization. Requirements such as the need for remote employees to access the network or encrypted traffic rules must be considered. Each organization is different, and these differences will decide the appropriate VPN choice.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Vendor support</strong>: The following are the two factors to consider in vendor support.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">The first factor is the number of servers and their location. The VPN should be selected according to the location of the vendor server and the activities performed.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Does the vendor limit connections, use bandwidth throttling, or restrict service? VPNs that control bandwidth, reduce Internet speeds, or limit them in any way should not be used in an organization. Moreover, care should be taken while dealing with the protocols and services running in the network. The organization must decide whether the existing services and protocols running are actually required.</li></ul></div>
