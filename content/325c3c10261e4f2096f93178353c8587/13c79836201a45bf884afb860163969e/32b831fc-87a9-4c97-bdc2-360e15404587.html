  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">UBA is the process of tracking user behavior to detect malicious attacks, potential threats, and financial frauds. It provides advanced threat detection in an organization to monitor specific behavioral characteristics of the employees. UBA technologies are designed to identify any unusual variations in traffic patterns caused by users, who can be either disgruntled employees or malicious attackers. UBA is used as a defense mechanism to address anomalous user behavior to overcome the most complicated issues faced by security professionals today.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The employees working in a company access different websites, tools, and applications. All their activities are logged and monitored. While these applications are running, there is a possibility of an intruder gaining access to the IT system and stealing credentials without the knowledge of the user. When an intruder (external attacker or an insider) stays on the company’s network as a legitimate user, UBA distinguishes this unusual behavior of the account by comparing the behavior baselines of both the user and the attacker; it then issues an alert on its database and highlights the risk scores. When an alert is issued, a notification is sent to the user’s personal device for confirmation. In case the user does not confirm this activity, it is considered a major security breach. Through UBA, the user’s account can be disabled by the security teams depending on the severity of the incident and the risk level.</p></div>
