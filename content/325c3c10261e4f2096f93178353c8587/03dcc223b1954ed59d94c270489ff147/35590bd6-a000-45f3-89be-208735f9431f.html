  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A firewall is a software or hardware, or a combination of both, which is generally used to separate a protected network from an unprotected public network. A firewall is a secure, reliable, and trusted device placed in between private and public networks. It helps in protecting a private network from the users of a different network. It monitors and filters the incoming and outgoing traffic of the network and prevents unauthorized access to private networks. It has a set of rules for tracing the incoming and outgoing network traffic and is also responsible for allowing or denying traffic to pass through. These criteria are the rules and restrictions configured on the firewall and they may vary from one type of firewall to another. Generally, a firewall filters traffic based on the type of traffic, source or destination addresses, protocols, and ports.</p></div>
