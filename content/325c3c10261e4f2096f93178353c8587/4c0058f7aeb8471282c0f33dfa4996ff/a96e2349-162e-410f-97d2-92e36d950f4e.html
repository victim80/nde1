The following are common technologies used to deploy VPNs for secure data transmission.</p><p><strong>Trusted VPN</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Even before the popularity of the Internet, service providers provided customers with specific circuits that could not be used by anyone else. Companies leased circuits from a communications provider and used them in the same manner as physical cables in a private LAN. Organizations know and control the pathway for their transmission. This gave customers privacy and the ability to have their own IP addresses and policies. To provide security measures and avoid sniffing of the data, VPN providers are entrusted to maintain circuit integrity. This type of VPN is called a trusted VPN. The technologies used for implementing trusted VPNs over an IP network are Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) circuits, frame relay circuits, and MLPS.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">ATM and frame relay operate at layer 2 of the OSI model, and MLPS operates in between the data link layer and network layer. The requirements for a trusted VPN are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Any changes in the path of a VPN can be made only by a trusted VPN.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">All routing and addressing methods need to be described before creating a trusted VPN.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Only a VPN provider can inject, change, or delete the data in the path of a VPN.</li></ul><p><strong>Secure VPN</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Secure VPNs are used when the Internet became a corporate communications medium. The main goal behind implementing a secure VPN is to ensure complete security of the data in transit. In a secure VPN, all the data packets sent through the tunnel undergoes an encryption process at one end of the tunnel and decryption process at the other end. This thwarts any attempt from an attacker to obtain data in transit. Secure VPNs protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data but do not ensure the transmission path. The main requirements for secure VPNs are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">All the data packets in the traffic are encrypted and authenticated before sending to the client.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The client and server need to be in a mutual understanding before initiating the connection between each other.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">The security of the connection must be confirmed by unauthorized users.</li></ul><p><strong>Hybrid VPN</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hybrid VPNs are those with trusted VPNs as part of secure VPNs. They implement different network components of an organization simultaneously to confirm security at very low costs. A security professional takes extra time in differentiating between the data transfer among the trusted VPNs that are part of the secured VPNs. The secure part of a hybrid VPN is administered by the customer or the provider of the trusted part of the hybrid VPN. The main requirements for hybrid VPNs are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">There should be clear differentiation between the trusted VPN and secure VPN.</li></ul></div>
