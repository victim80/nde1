  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Docker is an open source technology used for developing, packaging, and running applications and all their dependencies in the form of containers, to ensure that each application works in a seamless environment. Docker provides platform-as-a-service (PaaS) through OS-level virtualization and delivers containerized software packages.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Engine:&nbsp;</strong>This is an application installed on the host machine and uses the following components to develop, assemble, ship, and run applications.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Daemon</strong>: This manages the Docker images, containers, networks, and storage volume, and processes the requests of the Docker API. It is responsible for container-related actions and communicates with other daemons in order to manage its services.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Engine REST API</strong>: This API is used by an application to communicate with the Docker daemon.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker CLI</strong>: This is a command line interface that is used to interact with the Docker daemon. Using CLI, users can execute commands (build, run, and stop applications) to a Docker daemon.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Systems Working Mechanism:&nbsp;</strong>The Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon using a REST API through Unix sockets or a network interface. The Docker client and the Docker daemon can run on the same system, or the user can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Architecture:</strong> The Docker architecture is based on a client-server model and has the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Client:</strong> This enables the users to communicate with the Docker environment. The key function of the Docker client is to retrieve the images from the registry and run them on the Docker host. Some of the common commands of the Docker client are:</li></ul><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>docker build<br>docker pull<br>docker run</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Host</strong>: This provides the user an environment to run an application. The Docker host consists of Docker daemon, images, containers, networks, and storage. The following components are objects of the Docker host.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Images</strong>: An image is a read-only binary template for building a container. Images are used to build a container or to configure the container with additional features. The container capabilities and requirements rely on the metadata of the images. Docker images are hosted by Docker registries.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Containers</strong>: A container is an encapsulated environment to run an application. A containerâ€™s access to resources is defined by the image. The user can also create a new image depending on the state of the container.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Networking</strong>: Docker has networking drivers to support networking containers. It implements networking in an application-driven manner.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Docker Registries</strong>: These are services that provide locations for storing and downloading images. While working with registries, frequently used commands are:</li></ul><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>docker push</strong></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>docker pull</strong></p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>docker run</strong></p></div>
