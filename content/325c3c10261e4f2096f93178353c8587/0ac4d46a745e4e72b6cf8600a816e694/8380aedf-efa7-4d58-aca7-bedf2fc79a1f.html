It sits between a regular application and the networking components of the OS. It is more useful for individual home users and it is suitable for mobile users who need digital security when working outside the corporate network. Further, it is easy to install on an individualâ€™s PC, notebook, or workgroup server. It helps protect your system from outside attempts at unauthorized access and provides protection against everyday Trojans and email worms. It includes privacy controls, web filtering, and more. A software firewall implants itself in the critical area of the application/network path. It analyzes the data flow against the rule set.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The configuration of a software firewall is simple compared to that of a hardware firewall. A software firewall intercepts all requests from a network to the computer to determine if they are valid and protects the computer from attacks and unauthorized access. It incorporates user-defined controls, privacy controls, web filtering, content filtering, etc., to restrict unsafe applications from running on an individual system. Software firewalls use more resources than hardware firewalls, which reduces the speed of the system. Examples of software firewalls include those produced by Norton, McAfee, and Kaspersky.</p><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li>Less expensive than hardware firewalls.</li><li>Ideal for personal or home use.</li><li>Easier to configure and reconfigure.</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li>Consumes system resources.</li><li>Difficult to uninstall.</li><li>Not appropriate for environments requiring faster response times.</li></ul></div>
