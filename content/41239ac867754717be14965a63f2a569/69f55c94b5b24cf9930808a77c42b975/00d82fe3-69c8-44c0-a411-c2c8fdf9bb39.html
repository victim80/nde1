  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.ftc.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act or GLBA) is a United States federal law that requires financial institutions to explain how they share and protect their customers’ private information. The Act requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services such as loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. The objective of the GLBA is to ease the transfer of financial information between institutions and banks, while making the rights of the individual through security requirements more specific.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, the key points include:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Protecting consumer’s personal financial information held by financial institutions and their service providers are the key points of the financial privacy provisions of the GLBA. Companies should give consumers privacy notices that explain the GLBA’s information-sharing practices, while customers can limit the sharing of their information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">If an organization violates GLBA, then</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>It is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 for each violation;</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Officers and directors of an organization shall be subject to, and personally liable for, a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation; and</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>The organization and its officers and directors shall also be subject to fines or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;">The top information protection requirements of GLBA include</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Financial Privacy Rules to be provided for consumers with privacy notice after the relationship is established with the consumer; and</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Safeguards Rules, which require organizations to develop a written information security plan describing its processes and procedures for protecting clients’ NPI.</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;">The Security and Encryption Requirements for GLBA include</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Organizations to establish required standards that related to the administrative, technical, and physical security of customer records and information; and</em></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Organizations to implement encryption to reduce the risk of disclosure or alteration of information—for example, strong key management practices, robust reliability, and securing the encrypted communication’s endpoints.</em></li></ul></div>
