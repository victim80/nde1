  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Before RAID technology was introduced, many organizations used a single drive to store data. RAID technology is now found across all storage devices in an organization. Advantages and disadvantages RAID depend on the implemented level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of RAID Systems</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance and reliability:</strong> RAID technology increases the read/write performance of the data on disks. The speed is much faster than when using a single drive as storage. It improves the performance by distributing the I/O. A RAID controller distributes data over several physical drives, ensuring that a single drive in the RAID system is not overburdened. RAID sustains the reliability of data even if a disk fails. Failed components can be replaced in a RAID system without shutting the system down. This feature is called hot swapping or hot plugging . The replacement process does not affect the network or how the other disks function.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parity check</strong>: Parity check is a process where the RAID system compares the data stored in a crashed system with the data stored in other disks. This check process is accomplished on all drives. The parity check is performed after mirroring the data. Regular parity checks detect the probability of a system crash, thereby preventing data loss.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data redundancy: </strong>A disk can fail anytime. Therefore, data redundancy is important for an organization. RAID provides enhanced data redundancy in case of a hardware failure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk striping</strong>: Disk striping improves the read/write performance of data. The data is divided into small chunks and spread over multiple disks. Depending on the implemented RAID level, the data is divided into bytes, bits, or blocks. Data reading and writing can be done simultaneously on a RAID system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>System uptime:</strong> This metric detects the reliability and stability of a computer. System uptime defines the time till which a system can be left unattended without any assistance. Configuring RAID on a system helps enhance system uptime. A high system uptime in an organization signifies a high productivity.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of RAID Systems</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Writing network drivers</strong>: RAID technology is designed to be widely used on servers. A major disadvantage of RAID technology is the writing of all network drivers. RAID technology is complex, and this process can be time consuming.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non compatibility:</strong> Different systems support different types of RAID drives. Certain hardware or software components may not be compatible with the RAID drive configured on a server. This non compatibility may lead to the RAID not functioning properly. The compatibility between RAID drives, hardware, and software must be checked prior to configuring a system. RAID can protect data for all applications available on the network. For example, RAID is not compatible with system imaging programs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loss of data</strong>: All RAID drives function in the same environment. They can become nonfunctional because of mechanical issues. Thus, the potential data loss increases if the disks fail one after another. When two drives fail at the same time, recovering the data from the disk becomes difficult. &nbsp;For example, RAID 5, where a drive used exclusively for parity cannot recreate the first drive if a second drive fails too.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Time consumed in rebuilding: </strong>The increase in drive capacity has been much more than the increase in transfer speed. Recovering data from drives with a large storage capacity can be time consuming. In such scenarios, rebuilding a failed disk can also be time consuming. Increasing the number of drives does not help increase the data transfer speed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost</strong>: Implementation of RAID technology can be costly. Organizations need to hire consultants to sustain its performance. It also requires external RAID controllers and hard drives to function correctly, and this adds to the overall cost.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">RAID cannot protect the data and offer a performance boost for all applications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">RAID should be maintained by commercial consultants.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">RAID configuration is difficult.</li></ul></div>
