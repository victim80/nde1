  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Although cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly complex, attackers continue to use various techniques to compromise the physical security of an organization. However, organizations are increasingly focusing on strengthening their IT security, which overshadows physical security. Physical security is the most overlooked aspect of security, and this fact has been brought to the notice of many organizations over the last five years. Knowing this fact, attackers are taking advantage of loopholes to compromise the physical security of organizations. According to data collected by the US Department of Health and Human Services Breach Portal, physical security breaches are among the most frequently occurring security incidents in organizations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">According to the findings of the fifth annual Horizon Business Continuity Institute (BCI) Scan Report, physical security is now perceived as a growing concern for business continuity professionals. According to this report, a degree of concern has been expressed with regard to the possibility of both an act of terrorism and a security incident such as vandalism, theft, or fraud disrupting the organization at some point.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Physical security breaches are vastly different from other security breaches. They can be performed with little to no technical knowledge. Physical security concerns arise because conventional security measures such as firewalls and IDSes do not ensure physical security. Deploying a firewall at various levels ensures security from different types of attacks but does not ensure the physical security of the organization. A conventional firewall is entirely unrelated to physical security as it works above the physical layer of the OSI model. Thus, conventional firewalls do not protect the physical layer of a network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A successful attempt at unauthorized physical access may lead to the theft, damage, or modification of information systems. A physical security breach can directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. Therefore, physical security forms the basis of any information security program in an organization. It entails restricting unauthorized physical access to the infrastructure, office premises, workstations, and employees of the organization.</p></div>
