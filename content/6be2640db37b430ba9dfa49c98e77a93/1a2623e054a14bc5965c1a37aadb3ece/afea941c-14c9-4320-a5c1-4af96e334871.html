Thus, the policies should be formulated according to the roles of users. Initially, minimum permissions should be provided to ensure security; the permissions can be extended in the future. The action types include list, read, write, permission management, and tagging. For example, if actions are selected from the List and Read access levels, they are used to grant read-only access to the users. An example of the actions of policies and their descriptions are given below.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The “service last accessed” data feature can be used to view the data on the Access Advisor tab on the IAM console. The same data can be viewed on the AWS Organizations section of the IAM console if the user is logged in with the credentials of the master account. This information can be used to view the unnecessary permissions to refine them accordingly. The events of an account in AWS CloudTrail Event History can be used to implement further granular permissions.</p></div>
