To understand and analyze various risk factors, proper security solutions must be incorporated to protect the IoT devices. The use of IoT security tools helps organizations to significantly limit security vulnerabilities, thereby protecting the IoT devices and networks from different kinds of attacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bevywise IoT Simulator</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.bevywise.com</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Bevywise IoT Simulator is an intelligible simulation tool to simulate tens of thousands of MQTT clients in a single box. It can be used to develop, test, and demonstrate IoT servers and managers. IoT Simulator can be configured to send real-time messages within a range or from a random set of values based on the time and client. Further, it can simulate dynamic messages in two message formats, namely, TXT and JSON, like real-world IoT devices. For flexibly varying the data published in every sequence and to make the data in sync with the real device, IoT Simulator supports four types of dynamic values to be sent as a part of messages: system variable timestamp and client identifier, random, range, linear, and constant. IoT events can be configured with a predefined dataset by uploading a CSV file.</p></div>
