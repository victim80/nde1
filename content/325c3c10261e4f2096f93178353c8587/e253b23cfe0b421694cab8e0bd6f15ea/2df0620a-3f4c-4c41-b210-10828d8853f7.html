  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A VPN concentrator is used for remote-access VPNs and allows the use of an encrypted tunnel to securely access a corporate or any other kind of network via the Internet. Concentrator models differ depending on the number of users and amount of throughput. A VPN concentrator is also used to encrypt WLAN or wired traffic.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A concentrator must not be mistaken for a gateway or firewall. It is a specialized device that receives a connection from VPN peers by authenticating them. It enforces the security policies with regards to virtual private networking. It takes the overhead of VPN management and encryption off gateways and local hosts. Furthermore, it reduces the operating cost of VPN administration. To configure a network connection, the user must configure the concentrator and set up client software; to use the VPN, the user should use the client software.</p></div>
