It helps in the remote pre-configuration and pre-set up of organizational email accounts for employees. MEM can enforce compliance and thwart unauthorized access by allowing only approved and authorized devices and applications to access the email.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enterprise mobility management</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Enterprise mobility management (EMM) consists of tools and technologies used in an organization to secure the data in employees’ personal (BYOD) and organizational devices. EMM acts as a comprehensive solution responsible for MDM, MAM, MTM, MCM, and MEM. It safeguards the enterprise data accessed and used by employee mobile devices. EMM can increase employee productivity as the IT admin can configure applications remotely and provide data access to employees.</p><p><strong>Mobile security management</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Mobile security management involves actions and precautionary steps for securing the organizational data and mobile devices used by employees. It can protect the organization’s network access, helps in device and application security, and enables secure access to the organization’s emails.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of the features of mobile security management:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Generates separate logical containers on mobile devices to prevent private apps from accessing the organization’s data</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Employs strong passcode techniques to restrict third-party access</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Automates updates of the devices and OS with the latest security patches</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Blacklists malicious applications</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Executes commands on lost mobile devices remotely</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Configures a VPN specifically for the organization’s data, resources, and applications</li></ul><p><strong>Remote wipe</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Remote wipe is a technique used for securing and protecting data from miscreants if a mobile device used by an employee was stolen or lost. This feature allows the device owner or the organization’s administrator to send a command that can delete or erase all the device data. This helps prevent perpetrators from compromising sensitive personal data or confidential organizational assets.</p><p><strong>Screen lock</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Screen lock is a feature in mobile devices that is used to secure data and prevent illegal access by perpetrators. Enabling screen lock in a mobile device can prevent access to private data in the mobile device even if it was lost or stolen. Screen lock can be set in a mobile device by using protection techniques such as a password, face lock, fingerprint lock, pattern, or PIN. Unlocking the screen involves a set of actions that needs to be performed correctly, failing which the device can lock out after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts.</p><p><strong>Passwords and PINs</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Passwords and PINs are basic security features used in all mobile devices. Using a secure PIN and complex password can protect private data of the employee and confidential information of the organization stored on a mobile device. A password or PIN acts as a simple but effective defense to safeguard the data from being accessed by any malicious user. A PIN consists of a sequence of numbers, without any letters or special characters. In contrast, a password comprises uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and special characters and are usually lengthier than a PIN.</p><p><strong>Biometrics</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Biometrics is an advanced and unique security technology that utilizes an individual’s physical attributes such as fingerprint, iris, face, voice, and behavior for verifying their identity. These data are stored in a database, and whenever the mobile device needs to be accessed, the user-provided data are compared with the stored data; access is allowed only if there is a match. Biometrics can be used to authenticate a user very easily, quickly, and securely. It also prevents the need for remembering complex passwords.</p><p><strong>Push notification services</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A push notification service is a messaging feature that originates from a server and enables the delivery of data or a message from an application to a mobile device without any explicit request from the user. It is a great marketing tool for maintaining contact with users. This service does not require any application to be opened for receiving the notification, and the text message in the notification will be displayed on the mobile device even if the application is closed or the screen is locked.</p><p><strong>Geolocation</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Geolocation is a technology that can identify the real-world geographical location of users or devices when connected to the Internet. It works on mobile devices through the GPS system and is accurate to the level of approximately one foot. Deploying geolocation in applications helps marketers in implementing their business and marketing techniques easily. Geolocation is also famous for offering a rich user experience for navigation through maps and for tracking people, devices, or vehicles having the GPS feature. Geolocation is also used in weather forecasting.</p><p><strong>Geofencing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Geofencing is a technique through which mobile-application marketers utilize the location of the user to gather information. This technique can determine how close the user’s mobile device is to an exact location by using the GPS feature. A geofence is a virtual fence that is positioned at a location and interacts with mobile users whenever they cross the fence. This helps marketers gather sensitive data and know about users’ offline activities from the location data. It uses cellular triangulation for locating the user’s device with an accuracy level of 50–50,000 m.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the main advantages of using geofencing for marketing:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Send promotions directly to clients</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Improve sales locally</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Reduce cost on paid advertising</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Obtain data on user experience for further improvement</li></ul><p><strong>Full device encryption</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Full disk encryption is a security feature that can encrypt all the information stored on any storage medium within a mobile device. This technique encodes the user’s information stored on the mobile device by using an encryption key. It is useful for automatically encrypting data, which can be decrypted using the key. It employs encryption algorithms such as the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with cipher-block chaining (CBC).</p><p><strong>Containerization</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Containerization is a technique in which all personal and organizational data are segregated on an employee’s mobile device. With the increasing adoption of BYOD policies, using this technique substantially helps in improving the security of organizational data. It also improves productivity and enables the easy use of company resources and applications. These applications do not have any control of or communication with the private applications or data of the employees as they exist outside the container.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the benefits of containerization:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">By default, containers are encrypted to secure corporate data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Data cannot enter or exit the container.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Data are shared only between the apps within the container.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Containerization provides complete control over the container’s workspace.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Containerization provides privacy to the user’s data on the mobile device.</li></ul></div>
