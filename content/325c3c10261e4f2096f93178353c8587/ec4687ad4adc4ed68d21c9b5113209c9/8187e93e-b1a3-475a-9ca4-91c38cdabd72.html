  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Notify the security policy administrator on firewall changes and document them. Document any changes made to the firewall. With firewalls, it is especially critical to document the rules that have been added or changed so that other administrators know the purpose of each rule and who to contact about them. Good documentation can make troubleshooting easier and it reduces the risk of service disruptions that are caused when a deletion or change in rule the security professional is unable to understand.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Remove unused or outdated rules. Organizations can generate analysis reports to evaluate firewall access rules. This assists in identifying rules that overlap or are conflict with other rules in the access rule policy. Delete, move, or edit conflicting rules using the data from the report. Organizations can develop an easier to use and more efficient access rules policy if they eliminate unnecessary rules.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Implement a consistent workflow solution to manage and streamline the firewall change process. Identify potential risks and fix configuration errors before making changes to the firewall. Reduce the time required to evaluate and implement the changes to support the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Clean up and optimize the firewall rule base.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Schedule regular firewall security audits.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep a log of the firewall rules and configuration changes.</li></ul></div>
