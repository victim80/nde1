  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Various types of locking systems are available to improve the restriction of unauthorized physical access. The organization should select an appropriate locking system according to their security requirements.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the different types of locks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mechanical locks</strong>: These provide an easy method to restrict unauthorized access in an organization. Mechanical locks come with or without keys. There are two types of mechanical locks.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Warded lock</strong>: A warded lock contains a spring-loaded bolt attached to a notch. A key inserted into the notch moves the bolt backward and forward. Only the correct key can be inserted into the notch, which blocks incorrect keys.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tumbler lock</strong>: A tumbler lock consists of metal pieces inside a slot in the bolt. This prevents the bolt from moving. A correct key contains grooves that allow the bolt to move by raising the metal pieces above the bolt. Tumbler locks are further classified into pin tumbler, disk tumbler, and lever tumbler locks.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Digital locks</strong>: Digital locks require fingerprints, smart cards, or keypad PINs to unlock. It is easy to handle and does not require keys, eliminating the chance of forgetting or losing keys. It provides automatic locking for doors. The user only has to use their fingerprint impression, swipe their smart card, or enter the PIN to unlock it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Electric/electromagnetic locks</strong>: Electric locks or electronic locking systems operate on electric current. Locking and unlocking are achieved by supplying and eliminating power. The locks are activated or deactivated mainly using magnets or motors. They do not require keys to be maintained for the locking system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An electromagnetic lock or magnetic lock consists mainly of an electromagnet and an armature plate. The locking device can be of two types: fail safe and fail secure. Fail secure locks remain locked even during power loss, whereas fail safe locks remain inactive when de-energized. The electromagnetic part may be placed on a door frame, and the armature plate may be placed on the door. The magnetic flux created by the electromagnet creates an attractive force towards the armature plate, which initiates the door closing process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Combination locks</strong>: These require the user to provide a combination of numbers and letters to unlock. Users may enter the combination sequence either through a keypad or by using a rotating dial that intermingles with several other rotating discs. Combination locks do not use keys for functioning.</p></div>
