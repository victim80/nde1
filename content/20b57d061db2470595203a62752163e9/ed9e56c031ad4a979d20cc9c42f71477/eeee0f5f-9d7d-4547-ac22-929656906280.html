  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Government Access to Keys (GAK) refers to the statutory obligation of individuals and organizations to disclose their cryptographic keys to government agencies. It means that software companies will give copies of all keys (or at least enough of the key such that the remainder can be cracked) to the government. Law enforcement agencies around the world acquire and use these cryptographic keys to monitor suspicious communication and collect evidence of cybercrimes in the interests of national security. The government promises that it will hold on to the keys in a secure manner and only use them when a court issues a warrant to do so. To the government, this issue is similar to the ability to wiretap phones.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Government agencies often use key escrow for uninterrupted access to keys. Key escrow is a key exchange arrangement in which essential cryptographic keys are stored with a third party in escrow. The third party can use or allow others to use the encryption keys under certain predefined circumstances. The third party, with regard to GAK, is generally a government agency that may use the encryption keys to decipher digital evidence under authorization or a warrant from a court of law. However, there is growing concern about the privacy and security of cryptographic keys and information. Government agencies are responsible for protecting these keys. Such agencies generally use a single key to protect other keys, which is not a good idea, as revealing a single key could expose the other keys.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">These agencies are not aware of how confidential the information protected by the keys is, which makes it difficult to judge how much protection is required. In cases where seized keys also protect other information that these agencies have no right to access, the consequences of key revelation cannot be determined, because government agencies are not aware of the information that the keys protect. In such cases, the key owner is liable for the consequences of key revelation. Before owners hand over their keys to government agencies, they need to be assured that the government agencies will protect these keys according to a sufficiently strong standard to protect their interests.</p></div>
