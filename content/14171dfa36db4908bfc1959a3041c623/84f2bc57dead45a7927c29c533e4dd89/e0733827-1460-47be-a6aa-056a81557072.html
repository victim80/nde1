  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A wireless AP is termed as a rogue AP when it is installed on a trusted network without authorization. An inside or outside attacker can install rogue APs on a trusted network for their malicious intent.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Types of Rogue APs</strong></p><ol><li style="text-align:justify;">Wireless router connected via a “trusted” interface</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Wireless router connected via an “untrusted” interface</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Installing a wireless card into a device that is already on a trusted LAN</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Enabling wireless on a device that is already on a trusted LAN</li></ol><p style="text-align:justify;">The methods mentioned below should be used for detecting wireless networks in the vicinity of the network and the detected wireless APs should be compared with the wireless device inventory for the environment. If an AP that is not listed in the inventory is found, it can generally be considered as a rogue AP.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wireless scanning:&nbsp;</strong>It performs an active wireless network scanning to detect the presence of wireless APs in the vicinity. It helps in detecting unauthorized or hidden wireless APs that can be malicious. Discovery of an AP not listed in the wireless device inventory indicates the presence of a rogue AP. You can use wireless discovery tools such as inSSIDer, NetSurveyor, NetStumbler, Vistumbler, Kismet, etc., to detect wireless networks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wired network scanning:&nbsp;</strong>Wired network scanners such as Nmap are used for identifying a large number of devices on a network by sending specially crafted TCP packets to the device (Nmap-TCP fingerprinting). It helps locate rogue APs attached to a wired network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) polling:&nbsp;</strong>Simple network management protocol (SNMP) polling is used for identifying the IP devices attached to a wired network. SNMP detection utilities such as SolarWinds SNMP Scanner, Lansweeper, etc., can be used for identifying SNMP enabled devices on the network.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note:</strong> To use SNMP polling, the SNMP service on all IP devices in the network should be enabled.</p></div>
