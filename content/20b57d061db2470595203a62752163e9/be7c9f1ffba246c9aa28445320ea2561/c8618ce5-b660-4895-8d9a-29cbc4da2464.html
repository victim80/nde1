  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The digital signature algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for digital signatures. The NIST proposed the DSA for using it in the digital signature standard (DSS), adopted as a FIPS 186. The DSA helps in the generation and verification of digital signatures in sensitive and unclassified applications. It creates a 320-bit digital signature with a 512–1024 bit security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A digital signature is a mathematical scheme used for the authenticating digital messages. Computation of a digital signature uses a set of rules (i.e., the DSA) and a set of parameters, using which a user can verify the identity of the signatory and the integrity of the data.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Processes involved in DSA:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Signature generation process</strong>: A private key is used to sign the digital message.</li><li><strong>Signature verification process</strong>: A public key is used to verify whether the given digital signature is genuine.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">DSA is a public-key cryptosystem as it involves the use of both private and public keys.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Benefits of DSA:</strong></p><ul><li>Less chances of forgery than in the case of a written signature</li><li>Quick and easy method for business transactions</li><li>Fake currency problem can be drastically reduced</li></ul><h4><strong>Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman formulated RSA, a public-key cryptosystem for Internet encryption and authentication. RSA uses a modular arithmetic and elementary number theory for performing computations using two large prime numbers. The RSA system is widely used in a variety of products, platforms, and industries and is one of the de-facto encryption standards. Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Sun, and Novell incorporate the RSA algorithm in their operating systems. RSA can also be found on hardware secured telephones, ethernet network cards, and smart cards.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following sequence is an example of how cryptography uses the RSA algorithm in a practical exchange:</p><ul><li>The sender encrypts a message using a randomly chosen DES symmetric key. DES is a relatively insecure symmetric-key system that uses 64-bit encryption (56 bits for key-length, 8 bits for cyclic redundancy check) to encrypt data.</li><li>The sender then looks up the recipient’s public key and uses it to encrypt the DES key using the RSA system.</li><li>The sender transmits an RSA digital envelope, consisting of a DES-encrypted message and an RSA-encrypted DES key, to the recipient.</li><li>The recipient decrypts the DES key using his/her RSA private key and uses it to decrypt the message itself.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">This system combines the high speed of DES with the key management convenience of the RSA system.</p></div>
