There are different types of filters in firewalls ranging from simple packet filters to complex application filters. The defense-in-depth approach using layered filters is a very effective way to block attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Configuring administrator accounts to run a firewall depends on the security requirements of the organization and different administrative roles the organization requires. A role defines the type of access the associated administrator has been granted to the firewall system. If possible, create a unique ID to run the firewall services rather than running it as administrator or root.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">While creating a firewall ruleset, organizations should first determine what type of traffic is needed to run the approved applications. Then set the firewall rules to deny all the traffic and allow only those services the organization needs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Change all the default passwords and create a strong password that is not found in any dictionary. A strong password to ensure brute-force attacks also fail.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Firewalls use a complex rule base to analyze applications and determine if the traffic should be allowed through or not. Setting up firewall rules to grant access to important applications and blocking the rest will improve the performance of the firewall.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ensure that the date, time, and time zone on the remote syslog server matches the network configuration in order for the server to send syslog messages. Syslog data is not useful for troubleshooting if it shows the wrong date and time. In addition, configuring all network devices to use network time protocol (NTP) ensures correct and synchronized system clocks on all network devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Monitor the firewall logs at regular intervals even if the company's management policy allows for some private use of its equipment. Monitoring what websites employees are visiting, what files they are sending and receiving, and even the content in their emails will assist in maintaining the network securely.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Logging firewalls ‘allow’ actions offer greater insight into malicious traffic and tracking firewall ‘deny’ actions help identify threats.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Take regular backups of the firewall logs—at least on a monthly basis—and store these backups on secondary storage devices for future reference or for legal issues in case there is an incident. The best way to achieve this is to use a scheduling function in the firewall. Backup the firewall before and after making a change in its rules and ensure that the backup configuration file is usable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Perform audits at least once every year on firewalls to evaluate the standards implemented to secure the organization's IT resources. This will offer a record of all the files employees access, including failed attempts. Ensuring every change is accounted for will greatly simplify audits and help the daily troubleshooting.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Firewalls cannot secure the network from internal attacks. Organizations are required to implement different strategies such as policies that restrict employee usage of external devices in the internal network. For preventing any internal network attacks, install monitoring software that will help detect any suspicious internal activity.</li></ul></div>
