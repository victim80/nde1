  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A typical IoT-enabled IT environment comprises devices/things that use a gateway for communicating over a network to access an organization’s back-end servers running an IoT cloud platform. This IoT platform allows integrating the IoT information into the organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The different tiers of an IoT-enabled IT environment are discussed below.</p><p><strong>Things/Devices Tier</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The things/devices tier include smartphones, wearable devices, autonomous machines, and tags (RFID, NFC, QR codes) that can gather data using their embedded sensors, which can track key parameters related to the physical environment. Some examples for these parameters are air quality, humidity, light, and pressure. To transfer these telemetry data/command and control requests from IoT devices through a gateway to the cloud, protocols based on wired and wireless networking standards are used. Moreover, the command and control data are transferred from the cloud through the gateway to the devices. These devices can control the state of another device. For example, they can switch off faulty devices or raise an alarm about them. Thus, these IoT devices allow remote control.</p><p><strong>Gateway/Control Tier</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The gateway/control tier focuses on communication, offload processing functions, and the driving of required actions. The gateway pre-processes the huge amount of data generated by sensors before sending it to the cloud tier; thus, it reduces the amount of unwanted data forwarded to the cloud tier. This process can reduce the costs of network transmission and allow the application of rules based on incoming data. The gateway can issue control information such as configuration changes to the devices while responding to the data tier’s command and control requests such as authentication requests (bidirectional functioning). Moreover, the gateway acts as a proxy/edge device to legacy and low-power devices that cannot directly register and communicate with the IoT platform. In particular, the gateway can route commands received from the back-end to the respective device. All the new IoT devices, legacy devices, and edge devices form the IoT device layer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A typical control tier facilitates efficient communication through a personal area network (PAN), a local area network (LAN), Bluetooth, Zigbee, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)/TCP, etc., and micro-computing (micro-multi core chips).</p><p><strong>Communication/Data Center/Cloud IOT Platform/Cloud Tier</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The communication/data center/cloud IoT platform/cloud tier focuses on data computation to deliver insights and thereby generate business value. It acts as middleware by orchestrating the entire IoT workflow. It provides back-end business analytics to run event processes such as data analysis for creating and adapting business rules based on historical trends and then spreads business rules downstream. It needs to scale horizontally (for supporting an increasing number of IoT devices) and vertically (for addressing different IoT solutions). The cloud tier’s key functions include the following:</p><ul><li>Event processing and analysis</li><li>Data storage</li><li>Message and connectivity routing</li><li>Application integration and enablement</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">A typical cloud tier comprises software as a service (SaaS), business data analysis, user access controls, remote web servers, etc., and open/small operating systems (OSes) such as Linux.</p></div>
