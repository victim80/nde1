  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IoT technology uses various technical communication models, each with its own characteristics. These models highlight the flexibility with which IoT devices can communicate with each other or with the client. Discussed below are four communication models and the key characteristics associated with each model:</p><p><strong>Device-to-Device Communication Model</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In this type of communication, inter-connected devices interact with each other through the Internet, but they predominantly use protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave or Bluetooth. Device-to-device communication is most commonly used in smart home devices such as thermostats, light bulbs, door locks, CCTV cameras, and fridges, which transfer small data packets to each other at a low data rate. This model is also popular in communication between wearable devices. For example, an ECG/EKG device attached to the body of a patient will be paired to his/her smartphone and will send him/her notifications during an emergency.</p></div>
