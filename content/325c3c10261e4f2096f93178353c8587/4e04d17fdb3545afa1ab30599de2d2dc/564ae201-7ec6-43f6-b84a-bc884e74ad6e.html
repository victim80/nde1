  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A bastion host is a system that has multiple network interfaces exposed to the Internet. The operating system on such a device is made tough to create more security than on any other computer in the network. After the configuration of the computer and installation of the software, the rule sets for internal and external traffic may be installed and configured on top of the hardened operating system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All the network services are disabled on the bastion hosts. They allow only specified Internet access. For example, there must not be any user accounts on the bastion server, which creates the possibility of a user logging on to the system and taking control of it and also accessing the Internet. Even the network file system, which offers access to files across the network, must also be disabled so that it does not create an opportunity to access the bastion server and files that can be accessed on the Internet. The safest place to place the host is in the subnet as a component of the firewall. The main advantage of placing them in their own network is that it makes it difficult to compromise them with no other resource on the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Bastion servers create all the logs, which can be used by the intranet administrator, to tell if there has been an attack or attempts to attack. Two copies of system logs are maintained as the backup for various security reasons. One of the possible methods to back up the security logs is by connecting the bastion host to a dedicated computer, which functions only to keep track of the secure backup logs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Automated monitors are more complex programs than auditing software. Automated monitors frequently check the bastion server’s system logs, and it raises alarms if any suspicious activities are found in the system’s logs. For example, an alarm is raised if it finds any unsuccessful attempts by a user with three different logins.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The number of bastion hosts in a firewall is not restricted to a certain number. Every bastion host can manage multiple Internet services on the same intranet. In some instances, the bastion host can be used as a victim machine. The victim machine can then be used to handle the Internet service that cannot be managed by the proxying or by those Internet services where security issues are not known. The services are substituted in the victim’s machine instead of the bastion host with other services. It acts as a backup to the bastion servers even if the server is down.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the filtering router is placed between the bastion host and the intranet, it can be an added security. The filtering router drops all the unauthorized packets after checking all the packets between the Internet and intranet.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The bastion server cannot manage the requests such as sending a web page or delivering email when it receives a request for service. The request is sent across to the suitable intranet server. The intranet server processes the request, and the reply is sent back to the bastion server. The bastion server dispatches the requested service to the requester.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A few bastion servers incorporate auditing programs, which check if an attack has been launched against them. There are several ways of auditing. One can use the checksum program to audit, which is used to check if any unauthorized person has modified any software on the bastion server. The checksum is calculated based on the size of an executable program installed on the server. This program calculates the checksum to see if there are any modifications. If there are any changes in the checksum, these changes are the indications of an attack.</p></div>
