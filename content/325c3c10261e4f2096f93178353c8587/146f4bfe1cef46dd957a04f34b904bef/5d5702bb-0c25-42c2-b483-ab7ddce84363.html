  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Honeypots are classified into the following types based on their design criteria:</p><p><strong>Low-interaction Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Low-interaction honeypots emulate only a limited number of services and applications of a target system or network. If the attacker does something that the emulation does not expect, the honeypot will simply generate an error. They capture limited amounts of information, i.e., mainly transactional data, and some limited interactions. These honeypots cannot be compromised completely. They are set to collect higher-level information about attack vectors such as network probes and worm activities. Some examples are KFSensor, and Honeytrap.</p><p><strong>Medium-interaction Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Medium-interaction honeypots simulate a real OS as well as applications and services of a target network. They provide greater misconception of an OS than low-interaction honeypots. Therefore, it is possible to log and analyze more complex attacks. These honeypots capture more useful data than low-interaction honeypots. They can only respond to preconfigured commands; therefore, the risk of intrusion increases. The main disadvantage of medium-interaction honeypots is that the attacker can quickly discover that the system behavior is abnormal. Some examples of medium-interaction honeypots include HoneyPy, Kojoney2, and Cowrie.</p><p><strong>High-Interaction Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Unlike their low- and medium-interaction counterparts, high-interaction honeypots do not emulate anything; they run actual vulnerable services or software on production systems with real OS and applications. These honeypots simulate all services and applications of a target network. They can be completely compromised by attackers to gain full access to the system in a controlled area. They capture complete information about an attack vector such as attack techniques, tools, and intent. The honeypotized system is more prone to infection, as attack attempts can be carried out on real production systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A honeynet is a prime example of a high-interaction honeypot. It is neither a product nor a software solution that a user installs. Instead, it is an architecture—an entire network of computers designed to attack. The idea is to have an architecture that creates a highly controlled network with real computers running real applications, in which all activities are monitored and logged.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">“Bad guys” find, attack, and break into these systems through their own initiative. When they do, they do not realize that they are in a honeynet. Without the knowledge of the attackers, all their activities and actions, from encrypted SSH sessions to email and file uploads, are captured by inserting kernel modules into their systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">At the same time, the honeynet controls the attacker's activity. Honeynets do this by using a honeywall gateway, which allows inbound traffic to the victim’s systems but controls the outbound traffic using intrusion prevention technologies. This gives the attacker the flexibility to interact with the victim’s systems but prevents the attacker from harming other non-honeynet computers.</p><p><strong>Pure Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Pure honeypots emulate the real production network of a target organization. They cause attackers to devote their time and resources toward attacking the critical production system of the company. Attackers uncover and discover the vulnerabilities and trigger alerts that help network administrators to provide early warnings of attacks and hence reduce the risk of an intrusion.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Honeypots are classified into the following types based on their deployment strategy:</p><p><strong>Production Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Production honeypots are deployed inside the production network of the organization along with other production servers. Although such honeypots improve the overall state of security of the organization, they effectively capture only a limited amount of information related to the adversaries. Such honeypots fall under the low-interaction honeypot category and are extensively employed by large organizations and corporations. As production honeypots are deployed internally, they also help to find out internal flaws and attackers within an organization.</p><p><strong>Research Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Research honeypots are high-interaction honeypots primarily deployed by research institutes, governments, or military organizations to gain detailed knowledge about the actions of intruders. By using such honeypots, security analysts can obtain in-depth information about how an attack is performed, vulnerabilities are exploited, and attack techniques and methods are used by the attackers. This analysis, in turn, can help an organization to improve attack prevention, detection, and security mechanisms and develop a more secure network infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The main drawback of research honeypots is that they do not contribute to the direct security of the company. If a company is looking to improve its production infrastructure, it should opt for production honeypots.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Honeypots are classified into the following types based on their deception technology:</p><p><strong>Malware Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Malware honeypots are used to trap malware campaigns or malware attempts over the network infrastructure. These honeypots are simulated with known vulnerabilities such as outdated APIs, vulnerable SMBv1 protocols, etc., and they also emulate different Trojans, viruses, and backdoors that encourage adversaries to perform exploitation activities. These honeypots lure the attacker or malware into performing attacks, from which the attack pattern, malware signatures, and malware threat actors can be identified effectively.</p><p><strong>Database Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Database honeypots employ fake databases that are vulnerable to perform database-related attacks such as SQL injection and database enumeration. These fake databases trick the attackers by making them think that these databases contain crucial sensitive information such as credit card details of all the customers and employee databases. However, all the information present in the database is fake and simulated. Such databases lure the attacker to perform attacks, with their vulnerabilities; from the attacks, the attack pattern and the threat actor’s TTP’s towards database attacks can be identified effectively.</p><p><strong>Spam Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Spam honeypots specifically target spammers who abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. Basically, spam honeypots consist of mail servers that deliberately accept emails from any random source from the Internet. They provide crucial information about spammers and their activities. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Email Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Email honeypots are also called email traps. They are nothing but fake email addresses that are specifically used to attract fake and malicious emails from adversaries. These fake email IDs will be distributed across the open Internet and dark web to lure threat actors into performing various malicious activities to exploit the organization. By constantly monitoring the incoming emails, the adversary’s deception techniques can be identified by the administrators and internal employees can be warned to avoid falling into such email traps.</p><p><strong>Spider Honeypots</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Spider honeypots are also called spider traps. These honeypots are specifically designed to trap web crawlers and spiders. Many threat actors perform web crawling and spidering to extract important information from web applications. Such crucial information includes URLs, contact details, directory details, etc. Spider honeypots are employed to trap such adversaries. A fake website will be emulated and presented as a legitimate one. Threat actors attempting to perform web crawling on such traps will be identified and blacklisted.</p><p><strong>Honeynets</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Honeynets are networks of honeypots. They are very effective in determining the entire capabilities of the adversaries. Honeynets are mostly deployed in an isolated virtual environment along with a combination of vulnerable servers. The various TTPs employed by different attackers to enumerate and exploit networks will be recorded, and this information can be very effective in determining the complete capabilities of the adversary.</p></div>
