  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">An appropriate backup type is one that does not have a major impact on bandwidth, cost, time required, and the organizationâ€™s resources. The three most common backup types are full, differential, and incremental.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Full backup:</strong> This is also called a normal backup. A full backup occurs automatically according to a set schedule. It copies all files and compresses them to save space. A full backup provides efficient data protection for the copied data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Differential backup</strong>: Differential backup is the combination of a full backup and an incremental backup. A differential backup backs up all the changes made since the last full backup.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Considering the above example, assume a full backup is scheduled for Sunday, and then a differential backup is scheduled to run until Saturday. Once the full backup is completed on Sunday, the differential backup will occur on Monday and the data that was changed will be backed up. On Tuesday, the backup will be for the changes made on Sunday and Monday. Then, on Wednesday, it will include the changes from Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incremental backup:</strong> Backups only files that have been changed or created after the last backup are copied to the backup media. The last backup can be of any type. Before an incremental backup is performed, the system should be backed up using a full or normal backup.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong>Assume a full backup of the system is scheduled for Sunday, and an incremental backup is scheduled from Tuesday to Saturday. Once the full backup is performed on Sunday, the incremental backup on Monday will only backup the changes that occurred on Sunday. This process will continue until Saturday.</li></ul></div>
