It is important for employees to know which of their actions is restricted while accessing the Internet. The Internet access policy helps keep employees informed on acceptable browsing. An Internet policy includes guidelines for permissible use of the Internet, system security, network setup, and IT service.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Internet access policies broken down into the four categories below:</p><ol><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Promiscuous Policy:&nbsp;</strong>This policy does not impose any restrictions on the usage of system resources. For example, with a promiscuous Internet policy, there is no restriction on Internet/remote access, nothing is blocked. A user can access any site, download any application, and access a computer or a network from a remote location. While this can be useful in corporate businesses where people travel or work at branch offices and need to access an organizational network, it also opens the computer to threats such as malware, viruses, and Trojans. Because of free Internet access, this malware can come in the form of attachments without user knowledge. Network defenders must be extremely alert while choosing this type of policy.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Permissive Policy:&nbsp;</strong>This<strong>&nbsp;</strong>policy is wide open, and only known dangerous services/attacks or behaviors are blocked. For example, in a permissive Internet policy, the majority of Internet traffic is accepted, except for several well-known and dangerous services/attacks. Because only known attacks and exploits are blocked, it is impossible for network defenders to monitor current exploits. They are always playing catch-up with new attacks and exploits.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paranoid Policy:&nbsp;</strong>A paranoid policy forbids everything. There is a strict restriction on all company computers, whether it is system or network usage. There is either no Internet connection or severely limited Internet usage. Users often try to circumvent such severe restrictions.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Prudent Policy:&nbsp;</strong>A prudent policy starts with all services blocked. The Network defender enables safe and necessary services individually. This provides maximum security and logs all activity such as system and network activities. According to this policy, nonessential services/procedures that cannot be made safe are not allowed.</li></ol></div>
