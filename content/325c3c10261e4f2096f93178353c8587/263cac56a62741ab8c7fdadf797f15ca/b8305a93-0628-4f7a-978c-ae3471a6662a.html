  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An alert is a graduated event that notifies that a particular event (or series of events) has reached a specified threshold and needs appropriate action by a responsible party. It generates incidents and/or issue tickets, indicating that something is wrong and requires immediate attention and monitoring. This alerting can be done in many ways such as sending emails, producing alerts on the desktop, etc. An alert may contain details such as what kind of event, duration of that event, when it occurred, where it occurred, in which device, and what OS or version is it running on.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Alerts are the domain of security devices and security-related systems. However, this is not fixed. For example, IDS/IPS analyzes all inbound network traffic and decides whether a specific connection is allowed or not, based on packet content. If it is identified that a specific connection is malicious, then it will take predefined actions or generate alerts to notify the users.</p></div>
