These factors are essential considerations and contribute to the successful operation of physical security in an organization. The main goal of physical security is the control and prevention of unauthorized access, while physical barriers restrict unauthorized people from entering the building. Physical barriers define the physical boundary of an area and divide vehicle traffic from pedestrians. The use of a physical barrier deters and delays outsiders from entering the premises. An intruder or outsider can compromise a barrier by spending time and money as well as planning and contemplating on the site architecture. To discourage these intruders, it is a good policy to use a multilayer approach that includes external barriers, middle barriers, and internal barriers. External barriers include fences and walls; although they are built to form a structure, they inadvertently act as an obstruction. Middle barriers are equipment used to obstruct traffic and people. Internal barriers include doors, windows, grills, glass, and curtains.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are different types of physical barriers used in a building.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fences/electric fences/metal rails</strong>: These form the first line of defense against a trespasser and are the most commonly used type of physical barriers worldwide. Fences/metal rails/electric fences generally mark restricted and controlled areas and prevent unauthorized access.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The aim of deploying physical barriers is as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Block and deter attackers</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Mark the boundary of the organization</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Protect security guards from external attacks</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Prevent the entry of vehicles</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Protect against explosive attacks</li></ul></div>
