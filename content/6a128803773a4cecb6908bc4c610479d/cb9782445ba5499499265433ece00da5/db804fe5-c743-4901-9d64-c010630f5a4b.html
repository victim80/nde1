  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A network traffic baseline helps understand the behavioral patterns of a network. It is a benchmark to differentiate between normal and suspicious traffic. Baselining allows a set of metrics to monitor network performance. These metrics define the normal working condition of an enterprise’s network traffic. The network traffic is compared with metrics to detect any changes in the traffic that could indicate a security issue in the network. A network traffic baseline establishes the accepted packets that are safe for the organization. Baselining the traffic facilitates the detection of suspicious activities on the network. Any deviation from the normal traffic baseline can be considered a suspicious traffic signature. The security professional should define a network baseline for their organization and validate the traffic against it. Baselining is more effective if it works in parallel with the organization’s policy. With the help of normal traffic baselining, security professional can judge the requirements to secure the network. Network traffic baselines differ between organizations and change over time according to the operating environment and prevailing threat scenario.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Although, there is no industry standard to measure network traffic performance baselines, there are network monitoring tools that provide estimates of what type of traffic is normal. A network traffic baseline should be defined for all incoming, and outgoing Internet traffic and wide area network (WAN) links. The network traffic baseline should also contain the traffic for critical business data and backup systems.</p><ul><li><strong>According to a network traffic baseline, normal traffic signatures for TCP packets should have the following characteristics:</strong></li><li><em>To establish a three-way handshake, TCP uses SYN, SYN ACK, and ACK bits in every session.</em></li><li><em>The ACK bit should be set in every packet, except for the initial packet, in which the SYN bit is set.</em></li><li><em>FIN ACK and ACK are used in terminating a connection. PSH FIN and ACK may also be used initially in the same process.</em></li><li><em>RST and RST ACK are used to quickly end an on-going connection.</em></li><li><em>During a conversation (after a handshake and before termination), packets only contain an ACK bit by default. Occasionally, they may also have a PSH or URG bit set.</em></li><li><strong>A suspicious TCP packet has one or more of the following characteristics:</strong></li><li><em>If both SYN and FIN bits are set, the TCP packet is illegal.</em></li><li><em>SYN FIN PSH, SYN FIN RST, and SIN FIN PSH RST are all variants of SIN FIN. An attacker sets these additional bits to avoid detection.</em></li><li><em>A packet having only a FIN flag is illegal as FIN can be used in network mapping, port scanning, and other stealth activities.</em></li><li><em>Some packets have all six flags unset; these are known as NULL flags and are illegal.</em></li><li><em>The source or destination port is zero.</em></li><li><em>If the ACK flag is set, then the acknowledgement number should not be zero.</em></li><li><em>If a packet has only the SYN bit, which is set at the beginning to establish a connection, and any other data are present, then it is an illegal packet.</em></li><li><em>If the destination address is a broadcast address (ending with 0 or 255), it is an illegal packet.</em></li><li><em>Every TCP packet has two bits reserved for future use. If either or both are set, then the packet is illegal.</em></li><li><strong>All conversations originating inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ) are trusted traffic items.</strong></li><li><strong>Any traffic violating the network policies is malicious traffic, e.g., the existence of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) traffic when this type is restricted indicates a potential issue.</strong></li><li><strong>Any Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic from unknown DHCP servers indicates a rogue DHCP server.</strong></li><li><strong>Mail traffic originating in the network but not sent to a mail server is suspect.</strong></li><li><strong>Any DNS traffic not sent to the DNS server is suspect.</strong></li><li><strong>Any outgoing traffic with internal addresses not matching the organization’s address space may be malicious.</strong></li></ul></div>
