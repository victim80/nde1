  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Security personnel/guards are hired to implement, monitor, and maintain the physical security of an organization. They are responsible for developing, evaluating, and implementing security functions such as the installation of security systems to protect sensitive information from loss, theft, sabotage, misuse, and compromise. Hiring skilled and trained security personnel can be an effective security measure for any organization. They play a crucial role in physical security. However, organizations generally do not consider this a core competency to invest in as part of their strategic plan.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations should hire security personnel by themselves and provide adequate training on physical security. Alternatively, they can contact dedicated physical security service firms to handle physical security for them. There are organizations dedicated to training security officers, providing standardized procedures, and managing security on a 24 × 7 × 365 schedule by sharing guards across different organizations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the people involved in physical security.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guards</strong>: Their responsibilities include screening visitors and employees at the main gates or entrance; documenting names and other details about visitors; conducting regular patrols on the premises; inspecting packages, luggage, and vehicles; managing vehicle traffic; and guiding visitors to the reception area after noting their details. Guards should maintain visitor logs and record entry and exit information. Guards generally handle the use of CCTV cameras as a deterrent as well as a mechanism to detect and possibly prevent an intrusion.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The plant’s security officers/supervisors</strong>: Their responsibilities include training and monitoring the activities of the guards; assisting guards during crisis situations; handling crowds; and maintaining the keys, locks, lights, greenery, etc. of the facility.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Safety officers</strong>: Their responsibilities include implementing and managing safety-related equipment installed around the facility and ensuring the proper functioning of this equipment.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chief information security officer (CISO)</strong>: In the past, it was common for the CISO of an organization to be an extremely technically competent individual who has held various positions with an enterprise security function or even has a networking or systems background. Today, a CISO is required to be much more than technically competent. The modern CISO must have a diversified set of skills to successfully dispatch their duties and establish the appropriate level of security and security investment for their organization.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Continuous training for security personnel can provide great benefits and an effective team for the organization. Regardless of the position, security-related personnel should be selected based on the experience and qualification required for the job. Executives should thoroughly evaluate the personnel’s past experiences and, based on this information, provide adequate training to fill the gap between the ability and skills necessary for the job.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An organization should train newly hired security personnel in the following areas:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Organizational culture, ethics, and professionalism</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Security policies and procedures</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Policy enforcement</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Trespassers and crowd management</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Handling emergency situations</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Human and public relations</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Patrolling procedures</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Managing workplace violence</li><li style="text-align:justify;">First aid and medical assistance</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Fire prevention</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Vehicle traffic management</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Handling foreign guests, invitees, etc.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Report writing</li></ul></div>
