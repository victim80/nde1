The subjects are those entities that perform certain actions on the system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Object:&nbsp;</strong>An object is an explicit resource on which an access restriction is imposed. The access controls implemented on the objects further control the actions performed by the user. Examples of an object are a file or a hardware device.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reference Monitor:&nbsp;</strong>A reference monitor monitors the restrictions imposed on the basis of certain access control rules. It implements a set of rules on the ability of the subject to perform certain actions on the object.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operation:&nbsp;</strong>An operation is an action performed by a subject on an object. A user trying to delete a file is an example of an operation. Here, the user is the subject, the action of deleting refers to the operation, and the file is the object.</li></ul></div>
