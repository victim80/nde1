  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">WEP was an early attempt to protect wireless networks from security breaches, but as technology improved, it became evident that information encrypted with WEP is vulnerable to attack. We discuss WEP in detail here.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is WEP Encryption?</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">WEP is a component of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standards. Its primary purpose is to ensure data confidentiality on wireless networks at a level equivalent to that of wired LANs, which can use physical security to stop unauthorized access to a network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a WLAN, a user or an attacker can access the network without physically connecting to the LAN. Therefore, WEP utilizes an encryption mechanism at the data link layer for minimizing unauthorized access to the WLAN. This is accomplished by encrypting data with the symmetric Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption algorithm, which is a cryptographic mechanism used to defend against threats.</p><p class="BodyText3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Role of WEP in Wireless Communication</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">WEP protects against eavesdropping on wireless communications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It attempts to prevent unauthorized access to a wireless network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It depends on a secret key shared by a mobile station and an AP. This key encrypts packets before transmission. Performing an integrity check ensures that packets are not altered during transmission. 802.11 WEP encrypts only the data between network clients.</li></ul><p class="BodyText3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Main Advantages of WEP</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> It prevents link-layer eavesdropping.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Access Control: </strong>It determines who may access data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> It protects the change of data by a third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Efficiency</strong></li></ul><p class="BodyText3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">WEP was developed without any academic or public review. In particular, it was not reviewed by cryptologists during development. Therefore, it has significant vulnerabilities and design flaws.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">WEP is a stream cipher that uses RC4 to produce a stream of bytes that are XORed with plaintext. The length of the WEP and secret key are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit key</li><li style="text-align: justify;">128-bit WEP uses a 104-bit key</li><li style="text-align: justify;">256-bit WEP uses 232-bit key</li></ul><p class="BodyText3" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flaws of WEP</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following basic flaws undermine WEPâ€™s ability to protect against a serious attack.</p><ul><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">No defined method for encryption key distribution:</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Pre-shared keys (PSKs) are set once at installation and are rarely (if ever) changed.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>It is easy</em> <em>to recover the number of plaintext messages encrypted with the same key.</em></li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">RC4 was designed to be used in a more randomized environment than that utilized by WEP:</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>As the PSK is rarely changed, the same key is used repeatedly.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>An attacker monitors the traffic and finds different ways to work with the plaintext message.</em></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>With knowledge of the ciphertext and plaintext, an attacker can compute the key.</em></li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">Attackers analyze the traffic from passive data captures and crack WEP keys with the help of tools such as AirSnort and WEPCrack.</li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">Key scheduling algorithms are also vulnerable to attack.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How WEP Works</strong></p><ul><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">CRC-32 checksum is used to calculate a 32-bit integrity check value (ICV) for the data, which, in turn, is added to the data frame.</li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">A 24-bit arbitrary number known as the initialization vector (IV) is added to the WEP key; the WEP key and IV are together called the WEP seed.</li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">The WEP seed is used as the input to the RC4 algorithm to generate a keystream, which is bit-wise XORed with a combination of the data and ICV to produce the encrypted data.</li><li class="BodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">The IV field (IV + PAD + KID) is added to the ciphertext to generate a MAC frame.</li></ul></div>
