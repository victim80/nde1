  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.16: Packet Filtering Firewall</p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are three methods available for configuring packet filters after determining the set of filtering rules:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 1:</strong> This rule states that it accepts only those packets that are safe, thereby dropping the rest.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 2:</strong> This rule states that the filter drops only those packets that are confirmed unsafe.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rule 3:</strong> This rule states that, if there are no specific instructions provided for any particular packet, then the user is given the chance to decide on what to do with the packet.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">A network packet can pass through the network by entering the previously established connection. If a new packet enters the network, the firewall verifies the packets and checks if the new packet follows/meets the rules. It then forwards the packet to the network and enters the new data packet entry of the connection in the bypass table. A packet filtering firewall is not expensive and neither does it affect network performance. Most routers support packet filtering. Packet filtering is a relatively low-level security measure that can be bypassed by techniques such as packet spoofing, where the attacker crafts or replaces packet headers that are then unfiltered by the firewall.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As can be judged from the name, packet filter-based firewalls concentrate on individual packets and analyze their header information as well as the directed path. Traditional packet filtering firewalls make their decisions based on the following information:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Source IP address:&nbsp;</strong>This allows the firewall to check if the packet is coming from a valid source or not. IP header stores the information about the source of the packet and the address refers to the source system IP address.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Destination IP address:</strong> This allows the firewall to check if the packet is heading toward the correct destination; the IP header of the packet stores the destination address of the packet.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Source TCP/UDP port:</strong> This allows the firewall to check the source port of the packet.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Destination TCP/UDP port:</strong> This allows the firewall to verify the destination port of a packet to allow or deny the services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TCP code bits:</strong> This allows the firewall to check whether the packet has a SYN, ACK, or other bits set for connecting.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Protocol in use:</strong> Packets carry protocols, and this field checks the protocol used and decides to allow or deny associated packets.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Direction:</strong> This allows the firewall to check whether the packet is coming from a packet filter firewall or leaving it.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interface:</strong> This allows the firewall to check whether the packet is coming from an unreliable site.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
