  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.1: Working Principle of Network Segmentation</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the above diagram, network segmentation is used for separating servers in which one firewall, two DMZ zones (demilitarized zones and an isolated layer3 subnet), and an internal zone are used.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Web servers and email servers are separated from the servers that do not require direct internet access, since both servers need to be internet-facing and they are vulnerable to attacks. Even if one of the internet-facing servers is compromised, the separation of both servers can reduce the damage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Bidirectional traffic is allowed from the internal zone and DMZ2 for backups/authentication via the active directory, whereas one-way traffic is only allowed from the internal zone to DMZ1. The proxy, email, and web servers of the DMZ1 are separated from the application and database servers of DMZ2 for enhanced security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The firewall allows internet traffic to DMZ1 via certain ports (80, 25, 443, etc.) and closes all the other ports (transmission control protocol (TCP)/user datagram protocol (UDP)), whereas it does not permit internet traffic to DMZ2.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If user workstations on the internal zone require internet access, the access gets directed through an HTTP proxy server in DMZ1 since the internal zone is isolated from the internet traffic. Even if a server in DMZ1 is compromised, the internal zone will remain secured since the traffic from the internal zone to DMZ1 is permitted only in one way.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The segmentation in the above diagram represents a firewall security zone segmentation that can optimize the network security. For added security, a cloud-based web filtering solution (e.g., WebTitan, TitanHQ, SolarWinds MSP, etc.) can be used which can allow filtering of the website requests and prevent end-users from accessing malicious websites.</p></div>
