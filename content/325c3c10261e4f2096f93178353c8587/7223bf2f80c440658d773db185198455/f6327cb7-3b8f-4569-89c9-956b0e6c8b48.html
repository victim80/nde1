It is a fake proxy run to frame attackers by logging traffic through it and then sending complaints to the victims’ ISPs. It has no authorized activity or production value, and any traffic to it is likely a probe, attack, or compromise. Whenever there is any interaction with a honeypot, it is most likely to be malicious. Honeypots are unique; they do not solve a specific problem. Instead, they are a highly flexible tools with many different security applications. Honeypots help in preventing attacks, detecting attacks, and information gathering and research. A honeypot can log port access attempts or monitor an attacker's keystrokes; these could be early warnings of a more concerted attack. It requires a considerable amount of effort to maintain a honeypot.</p></div>
