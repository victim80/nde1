  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Encapsulation is the method through which protocols have separate functions to communicate among each other by hiding the data. Data vulnerability increases if the data do not pass through a secure channel. When data are transmitted using VPN tunneling, the data are encapsulated to ensure security. Encapsulation relies on various technologies and protocols such as GRE, IPsec, L2F, PPTP, and L2TP.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The packets sent over a VPN are enclosed within another packet (encapsulation), which has a different IP source and destination. Concealing the source and destination of the packets protects the integrity of the data sent. The VPN tunnel acts as a path between the source and destination. To send the encapsulated data securely, it is necessary to establish a tunnel. All the data packets travelling through the tunnel are encapsulated at the source point and de-encapsulated at the destination point. To send the data to the destination point, a tunnel data protocol is created. The information in the data packet is called a payload. The tunnel data protocol encapsulates the payload within the header containing the routing information. Once the server receives the payload, it discards the header, de-encapsulates the payload, and sends it to the destination.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All data packets transmitted through a VPN network are encapsulated using a VPN base or a carrier protocol. The encapsulated data packet is then sent through the tunnel and later de-encapsulated at the receiverâ€™s end.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, a TCP/IP packet encapsulated with an ATM frame is hidden within the ATM frame. Upon receiving the ATM frame, the encapsulated packet is de-encapsulated to extract the TCP/IP packet.</p></div>
