  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">The following are some of the limitations of proxy servers.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single Point of Failure:&nbsp;</strong>An issue with a proxy server is the creation of a single point of failure. If the entire organization uses the same proxy, that machine is quite critical and should be configured properly. A common mistake is forgetting that a proxy is insecure. Although a proxy server protects the internal network, any interface directly connected to the Internet is wide open to attack. Organizations should ensure that the proxy is used in conjunction with other security mechanisms, such as a packet filter, to decrease the possibility of a direct intrusion attack on the proxy.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Proxy for Each Service:&nbsp;</strong>The proxy must be configured for each service. A network that allows numerous types of services in both directions can create considerable work. For supplementary services, it is important that the proxy server remains securely configured. The workload is high because the proxy must be configured for each and every service it provides.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Default Configurations:&nbsp;</strong>When implementing a proxy, it is recommended to avoid the use of the default configurations. Take time to follow the rules and restrictions. If some default settings are changed, the proxy server might not function properly.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Proxy servers have to reroute information; thus, web pages can occasionally load slowly.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">If the proxy server is attempting to bypass suspicious software, some elements of a page may not load.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As personal information is passed through an external server that could be accessed by intruders, data security can be compromised.</li></ul></div>
