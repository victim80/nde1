Use a step-by-step process to ensure a successful firewall implementation and deployment.

It is critical to conduct a security risk assessment to know where a threat to the network would most likely originate and the reasons behind it. Depending on the potential origin of threats, a layout for firewall implementation should then be built. Organizations must determine if they need to implement a firewall to enforce the new security policies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If an organization is considering implementing a firewall, remember to outline a consistent security policy in advance based on the risk assessment. The security policy must determine how basic communication will take place at the firewall, where the firewall must sit, and how to configure it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Configuring:</strong> Configuring a firewall involves configuring various components and features such as hardware, software, policy configuration, implementing logging, and alerting mechanisms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Testing:</strong> Testing a firewall involves examining it for any bugs. The firewall implementation test mainly focuses on whether the firewall rules are set according to the actions performed by the firewall. Firewall testing increases the reliability of the products using the firewall.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deploying:</strong> It is necessary to ensure the firewall is deployed according to the security policies of the organization. It is also necessary to alert the users of the deployment of the firewall. Similarly, the security policy of the firewall should be added to the networkâ€™s overall policy and any configuration changes during implementation should be included. Employing a phased approach to deploy multiple firewalls on a network helps detect and resolve issues regarding conflicting policies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Managing and Maintaining:</strong> Managing a firewall includes maintaining the firewall architecture, policies, software, and other components deployed on the network. Update the policy rules when they identify new threats and if requirements change. The security of the firewall can be ensured by constantly monitoring and addressing the issues in the network. Additionally, monitor the firewall logs continuously in order to detect new threats and attacks in the network. Perform a firewall log analysis to detect security incidents.</p></div>
