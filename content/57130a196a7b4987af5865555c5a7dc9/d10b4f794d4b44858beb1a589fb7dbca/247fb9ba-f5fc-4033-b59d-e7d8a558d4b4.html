  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are four main classifications of security defense techniques used for identification and prevention of threats and attacks in the network.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Preventive Approach: </strong>The preventive approach essentially consists of methods or techniques that can easily prevent threats or attacks in the target network. The preventive approaches mainly used in networks are as follows:<ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Access control mechanisms such as a firewall.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Admission control mechanisms such as NAC and NAP.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Cryptographic applications such as IPSec and SSL.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Biometric techniques such as speech or facial recognition.</li></ul></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reactive Approach: </strong>The reactive approach is complementary to the preventive approach. This approach addresses attacks and threats that the preventative approach may have failed to avert, such as DoS and DDoS attacks. It is necessary to implement both preventive and reactive approaches to ensure the security of the network. Reactive approaches include security monitoring methods such as IDS, SIMS, TRS, and IPS.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Retrospective Approach:</strong> The retrospective approach examines the causes for attacks in the network. These include:<ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Fault finding mechanisms such as protocol analyzers and traffic monitors.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Security forensics techniques such as CSIRT and CERT.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Post-mortem analysis mechanism including risk and legal assessments.</li></ul></li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Proactive Approach:</strong> The proactive approach consists of methods or techniques that are used to inform decision making for countering future attacks on the target network. Threat intelligence and risk assessment are examples of methods that can be used to assess probable future threats on the organization. The methods in this approach facilitate in the implementation of preemptive security actions and measures against potential incidents.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
