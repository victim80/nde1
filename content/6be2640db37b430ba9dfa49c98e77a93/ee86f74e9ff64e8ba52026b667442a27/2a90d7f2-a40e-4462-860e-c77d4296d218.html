Therefore, create groups and define specific rights and permissions for each group. Add IAM user accounts to these groups based on their job functions. This can help in modifying the IAM users of a specific group at one spot and reduce the access management complexity for organizations with numerous users and the accidental assignment of higher privilege to users. It is easy and less time-consuming to assign and reassign rights to groups. If the role of a user is changed, the IAM user account can be transferred to the new group.</p><ul><li>Click on <strong>Groups</strong> in the left pane under <strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM).</strong></li></ul></div>
