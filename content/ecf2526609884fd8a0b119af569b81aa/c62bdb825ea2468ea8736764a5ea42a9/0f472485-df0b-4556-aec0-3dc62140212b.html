With these devices, the attackers can easily introduce a malicious code in a network or carry sensitive data out of an organization. Hence, encryption is the best way to protect sensitive data from being taken out of an organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Encryption can be applied to removable media to prevent it from unauthorized access in case of loss or theft. This will add an extra layer of security to confidential information. Various encryption solutions are available in the market with different features. Some encryption solutions encrypt the data stored on a local drive, but not on USB devices, whereas some encryption solutions automatically encrypt the data stored on removable media. While selecting a removable media encryption solution, it is important to verify how it is configured to restrict access to devices using an authorized list, personal devices, an authorized file copy, and encryption keys.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac use a couple of methods to encrypt removable media such as USB drives. They use either built-in features or third-party encryption solutions to encrypt removable media.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Implementing Removable Media Encryption in Windows: BitLocker</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">To Enable Removable Media Encryption in Windows 10</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Plug the removable media device into a USB port on the computer.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Go to <strong>Start-&gt; Control Panel -&gt; BitLocker Drive Encryption</strong>.</li></ul></div>
