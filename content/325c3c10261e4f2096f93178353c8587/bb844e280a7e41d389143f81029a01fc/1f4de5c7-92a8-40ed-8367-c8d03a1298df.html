  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A VPN enables a secured connection over the Internet from a public network to a private network placed at a distant site. All the network traffic in a VPN is encrypted and passes through a virtual secure tunnel placed between the client and VPN server.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">All the packets passing through a VPN are encrypted or decrypted with respect to inbound or outbound traffic. The packets are encrypted at the client side and decrypted at the VPN server. A client willing to connect to a company’s network initially connects to the Internet. Then, the client initiates a VPN connection with the company’s server. Before establishing a connection, end points must be authenticated through passwords, biometrics, personal data, or any combination of these. Once the connection is established, the client can securely access the company's network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For example, when a client with a VPN connection enabled browses Youtube.com, the outbound traffic is encrypted at the client side. The encrypted data are then sent to the nearest VPN server, which passes the data to the gateway server. At the gateway server, the data are decrypted and sent to the server hosting Youtube.com. When Youtube.com sends a reply request, the VPN server performs the reverse process on the outbound traffic.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A VPN closely monitors any insecure networks. It creates a new IP address for an encrypted packet, concealing the real IP address; this prevents attackers from finding the real IP address from which the packets were sent.</p></div>
