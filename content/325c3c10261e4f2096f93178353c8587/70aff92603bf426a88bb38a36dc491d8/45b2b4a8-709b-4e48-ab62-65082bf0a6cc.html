  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A site-to-site VPN helps connect different networks. For example, the branch offices of an organization can be connected to the main campus through a site-to-site VPN. The main differentiation between a remote-access VPN and a site-to-site VPN is that a site-to-site VPN does not require any client software. The entire traffic is sent through a VPN gateway that encrypts the data packets passing through it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a site-to-site VPN, the outbound traffic passes through a tunnel to the VPN gateway. The data packets in the outbound traffic are encrypted at the gateway and passed to the tunnel over the Internet. The traffic is sent to the nearest gateway to the target location. The nearest gateway decrypts the data packets and then forwards them to the final destination.</p></div>
