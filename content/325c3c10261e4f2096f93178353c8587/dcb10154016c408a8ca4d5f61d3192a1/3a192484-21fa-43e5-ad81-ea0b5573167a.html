  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Command console software is installed and runs on a separate system that is dedicated to the IDS. It provides a user interface to an administrator for the purpose of receiving and analyzing security events, alert message, and log files. The command console evaluates security event information from different security devices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The IDS collects all the data from security devices and analyzes it using the command console. Administrators use the console to analyze alert messages triggered by the alert system and manage log files. The command console allows administrators in large networks to process large volumes of activities and respond quickly.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS collects information from security devices placed throughout the network and sends it to the command console for evaluation. Installing a command console on the system for other purposes such as backing up files and firewall functions, will make it slow to respond to events. Installing the command console on a dedicated system provides the benefit of a fast response.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Caution</strong>: If the command console is installed on a non-dedicated computer system (e.g., firewall, backup server), it will drastically slow down the response to security events as those systems may be busy handling other tasks.</p></div>
