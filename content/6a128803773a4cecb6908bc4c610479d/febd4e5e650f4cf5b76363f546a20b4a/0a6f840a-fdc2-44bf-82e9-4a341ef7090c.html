Network monitoring is a retrospective security approach that involves monitoring a network for abnormal activities, performance issues, bandwidth issues, etc. It is an integral part of network security and is a demanding task within the network security operations of organizations. Continuous network traffic monitoring and analysis are required for effective threat detection. Security Professional should constantly strive to maintain smooth network operation. If a network goes down even for a small period, productivity within a company may decline. To be proactive rather than reactive, the traffic movement and performance must be monitored to ensure that no security breach occurs within the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The network monitoring process involves sniffing the traffic flowing through the network. For this purpose, network packets must be captured, and a signature analysis must be conducted to identify any malicious activity.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Network operators use network traffic analysis tools to identify malicious or suspicious packets hiding within traffic. They monitor download/upload speeds, throughput, content, traffic behaviors, etc. to understand the status of the network operations.</p></div>
