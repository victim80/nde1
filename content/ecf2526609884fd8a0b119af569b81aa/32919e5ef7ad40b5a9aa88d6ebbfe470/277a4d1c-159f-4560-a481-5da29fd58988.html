  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the requirement of your organization, you can choose any RAID level. RAID levels are based on performance, fault tolerance, or both.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">RAID 0 deals with data performance. In this level, data is broken into sections and written across multiple drives. The storage capacity of RAID 0 is equal to the sum of the disksâ€™ capacities in the set. RAID 0 does not provide fault tolerance. It requires a minimum of two drives. It does not provide data redundancy. A failure of one disk can lead to the failure of all disks in a level 0 volume. The probability of recovering data from a RAID level 0 is minimal.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The data distribution in a RAID level 0 is equal among all the disk sets, resulting in high performance. With concurrent high performance, the throughput of the read and write operations on multiple disks is equal to the throughput of the array of disks. Increased throughput is an advantage of RAID 0, considering that data recovery is not available. Software and hardware RAID controllers support RAID 0, helping boost server performance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example: </strong>Assume that the IT infrastructure has a hard disk with high performance. The data in the hard disk is transferred at a remarkably high speed. All the large and critical files are stored in this disk. However, if this disk fails, the entire contents of the files will be affected, leading to the unavailability of the data. It is advisable not to store any critical data in a RAID level 0.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of RAID Level 0</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read and write performance: </strong>RAID level 0 has a good read and write performance. The performance is even better when the controller supports independent reads and writes to different disks in the array.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost:</strong> RAID level 0 is more cost effective than the other RAID levels.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation:</strong> Is easy to implement as the data is divided in a sequential set of blocks. There is no storage loss as the maximum capacity is utilized.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of RAID Level 0</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>No redundancy:</strong> With no data redundancy, data loss is greater.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Noncritical data:&nbsp;</strong>Data that is not critical to the organization can be stored on RAID level 0. This level does not use mirroring. Recovery is not possible if critical data is lost on RAID level 0.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unreliable:</strong> If one disk fails, the entire network will be affected. &nbsp;</li></ul></div>
