  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A bastion host is designed for defending a network against attacks. It acts as a mediator between inside and outside networks. A bastion host is a computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attacks. It provides a limited range of services such as website hosting, and mail to ensure security. Traffic entering or leaving the network passes through a firewall. A bastion host has two interfaces:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A public interface directly connected to the Internet</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A private interface connected to the intranet</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">A bastion host is the only host computer on the Internet that can be addressed directly from the public network. As these components are exposed to substantial risk, enormous effort is required in designing and configuring bastion hosts to minimize the probability of attacks. Various other types of bastion hosts are web, mail, Domain Name System (DNS), and FTP servers. Bastion hosts also provide packet filtering and proxy services.</p></div>
