  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Applications implementing HTTP send data in cleartext. Implementing HTTP can pose security risks to the organization as sensitive information such as usernames and passwords are sent over as HTTP requests. The attacker can easily sniff the traffic and steal sensitive information for malicious use. Therefore, security professionals must ensure that their HTTP traffic is sent over an encrypted protocol such as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Simultaneously, they should monitor applications and ensure that they do not send data over HTTP. Monitoring the HTTP traffic also helps detect the volume of HTTP traffic in the network. It also helps detecting malicious traffic, policy violation attempts, applications using unnecessary/restricted services.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Use the http filter to check the specific HTTP traffic.</p></div>
