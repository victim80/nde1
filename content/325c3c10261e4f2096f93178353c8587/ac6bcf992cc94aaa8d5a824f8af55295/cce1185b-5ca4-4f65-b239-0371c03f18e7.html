These firewalls use algorithms to examine, filter, and process the application-layer data instead of using proxies. Stateful multilayer inspection firewalls have many advantages such as high level of security, better performance, and transparency to end users. They are quite expensive because of their complexity.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Stateful multilayer firewalls can remember the packets that passed through them earlier and make decisions about future packets based on this information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">These firewalls provide the best of both packet filtering and application-based filtering.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances contain stateful firewalls.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">These firewalls track and log slots or translations.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">They check for those packets that do not comply with the filtration rules and drop them at the network layer of the protocol stack. The other packets forwarded to the next layer undergo another layer of filtration to confirm whether the packets are in the proper session. Packets that are currently not a part of the session are dropped at the TCP layer. Next, packets are filtered at the application layer, enabling the user to allow only authorized actions at the firewall.</p></div>
