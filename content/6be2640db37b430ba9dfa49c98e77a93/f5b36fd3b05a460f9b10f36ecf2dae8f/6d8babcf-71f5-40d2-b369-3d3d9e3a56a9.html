The separation of duties prevents conflicts of interest, illegal acts, fraud, abuse, and errors, and it helps in identifying security control failures, including information theft, security breaches, and invasion of security controls. It also helps in restricting the amount of influence held by an individual and ensures that there are no conflicting responsibilities. It is essential to know the limitations of each cloud service delivery model when accessing specific clouds and their models.</p></div>
