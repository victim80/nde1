As shown in the figure, the virtualization layer acts as middleware between the operating systems and the computer hardware. It logically partitions the hardware resources based on the requests received from the host and the guest operating systems. The host OS directly interacts with the computer hardware, but the guest OSes interact through the virtualization layer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Virtualization Approaches</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Various approaches can be adopted to achieve virtualization, as described below:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Full Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>In this type of virtualization, the guest OS is not aware that it is running in a virtualized environment. It sends commands to the virtual machine manager (VMM) to interact with the computer hardware. The VMM then translates the commands to binary instructions and forwards them to the host OS. The resources are allocated to the guest OS through the VMM.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>OS assisted Virtualization or Para Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>In this type of virtualization, the guest OS is aware of the virtual environment in which it is running and communicates with the host machine to request for resources. The commands are translated into binary code by the guest OS for the computer hardware. The VMM is not involved in the request and response operations.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hardware assisted Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>Modern microprocessor architectures have special instructions to aid the virtualization of hardware. These instructions enable the guest OS to execute privileged instructions directly on the processer. The operating system treats the system calls as user programs.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hybrid Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>In this type of virtualization, the guest OS adopts the functionality of para virtualization and uses the VMM for binary translation to different types of hardware resources.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Further, the design of a virtual environment may incorporate several levels of virtualization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some levels of virtualization that a virtual environment may leverage.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Storage Device Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>This is the virtualization of storage devices using techniques such as data striping and data mirroring. RAID is an example of storage virtualization, in which multiple storage devices are combined into a single logical unit.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>File System Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>This refers to the virtualization of data at the level of the file system. It facilitates convenience of sharing and protection of data within the software. Virtualized data pools manipulate files and data based on user demand.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Server Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>Server level virtualization enables the partition (or virtualization) of the server’s operating system environment. This involves the logical partitioning of the server’s hard drive.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fabric Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>This level of virtualization makes the virtual devices independent of the physical computer hardware. It creates a massive pool of storage areas for different virtual machines running on the hardware. Storage area network (SAN) technology is used to achieve fabric level virtualization.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Types of Virtualization</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operating System Virtualization:&nbsp;</strong>This type of virtualization enables the hardware to execute multiple operating systems simultaneously, thus enabling the user to run applications requiring different operating systems on a single system. This is done directly in the kernel of the operating system, which not only reduces hardware costs, but also saves time spent on updating software on multiple machines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network Virtualization</strong>: Virtualization has moved beyond just server and storage capacities and now encompasses the network as well. While actual hardware resources were visible and allocated to software in traditional networks, network virtualization creates an abstraction of these network resources. In network virtualization, multiple physical networks are combined into a single software-based virtual network, or a single physical network is divided and exists as multiple independent virtual networks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Server Virtualization</strong>: This is the virtualization of server resources such as physical servers, processors, and operating systems. This process enables the creation and abstraction of multiple virtual machines on a single server. Each virtual machine works independently and runs its own operating system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Desktop Virtualization</strong>: In this virtualization technology, the operating system instance, representing the user’s desktop, is located within a central server on the cloud. This enables the user to control the desktop on the cloud and use any device to access it. The data and files are not stored on the system with which the user accesses the desktop but are instead stored in the cloud. Virtualized desktops can be accessed through a server and are hosted on a remote central server, which could be a cluster of computers, thus enabling the user to maintain a desktop on a single central server or cloud. Desktop virtualization reduces the cost of ownership and downtime, enables centralized management, and may enhance security.</li></ul></div>
