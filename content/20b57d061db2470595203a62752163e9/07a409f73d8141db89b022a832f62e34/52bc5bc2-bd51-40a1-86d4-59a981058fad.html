  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a security architecture developed for increasing the confidentiality of the information exchanged over the Internet. It includes hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures required for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates. In cryptography, a PKI helps to bind the public keys with the corresponding user identities by means of a CA.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">PKI is a comprehensive system that allows the use of public-key encryption and digital signature services across a wide variety of applications. PKI authentication depends on digital certificates (also known as public-key certificates) that CAs sign and provide. A digital certificate is a digitally signed statement with a public key and the subjectâ€™s (i.e., a user, company, or system) name on it.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The components of a PKI include,</p><ul><li>A certificate authority (CA) that issues and verifies digital certificates</li><li>A registration authority (RA) that acts as the verifier for the CA.</li><li>A certificate management system for generation, distribution, storage, and verification of certificates.</li><li>One or more directories where the certificates (along with their public keys) are stored.</li></ul></div>
