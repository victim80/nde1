  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A security policy is a well-documented set of plans, processes, procedures, standards, and guidelines required to establish an ideal information security status of an organization. Security policies are used to inform people on how to work in a safe and secure manner; they define and guide employee actions on how to deal with organization sensitive operation, data, or resources. The security policy is an integral part of an information security management program for any organization</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security policy is a high-level document, or set of documents, describing the security controls to implement in order to protect a company. It maintains confidentiality, availability, integrity, and asset values. Security policies form the foundation of a security infrastructure. Without them, it is impossible to protect the company from possible lawsuits, lost revenue, and bad publicity, or even basic security attacks. Such policies accomplish three goals:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Reduce or eliminate the legal liability to employees and third parties;</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Protect confidential and proprietary information from theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or modification; and</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Prevent computing resource waste.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;">A security policy comprises objectives, rules for behavior, and requirements to secure an organizationâ€™s network and computer systems. Security policies function as a connecting medium between the objectives and security requirements, as well as to help users, staff, and managers protect technology and information assets. The policy provides a baseline to acquire, configure, and audit computer systems and networks. A security policy defines a set of security tools for preventing attacks on the entire network in order to keep malicious users away from an organization and provide control over perilous users within an organization.</p></div>
