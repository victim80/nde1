  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Packet filtering is the most basic feature of all modern firewalls. Packet filtering firewalls work at the network level of the OSI model (or the IP layer of TCP/IP). They are usually part of a router. Most routers support packet filtering. In a packet filtering firewall, each packet is compared to a set of criteria before it is forwarded. Depending on the packet and the criteria, the firewall can:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Drop the packet</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Forward it or send a message to the originator</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">They evaluate each packet based on the packet header information, including source IP address, destination IP address, source port, destination port, protocol, etc. If the packet header information does not match the ruleset, the firewall drops the packet; or else, it is forwarded. Rules can include source and destination IP address, source and destination port number, or the protocol used. When a data packet passes through the network, a packet filter checks the packet header and compares it with the connection bypass table that keeps a log of the connections passing through the network. &nbsp;The advantage of packet filtering firewalls is their low cost and low impact on network performance.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Traffic is filtered based on specified rules including source and destination IP address, packet type, and port number. Unknown traffic is only allowed up to level 2 of the network stack.</p></div>
