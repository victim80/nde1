  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Cloud storage is a medium used to store digital data in logical pools using a network. The physical storage is distributed to multiple servers, which are owned by a hosting company. Organizations can buy storage capacity from the cloud storage providers for storing user, organization, or application data. Cloud storage providers are solely responsible for managing the data and keeping the data available and accessible. Cloud storage services can be accessed using a cloud computing service, a web service API, or any applications that use the API, such as cloud desktop storage, cloud storage gateway, or web-based content management systems. The cloud storage service is operated from an off-premises service, like Amazon S3.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The cloud storage architecture possesses the same characteristics as cloud computing in terms of scalability, accessible interfaces, and metered resources. It is built on highly virtualized infrastructure and relies on multiple layers to provide continuous storage services to users. The three main layers correspond to the front-end, middleware, and back-end. &nbsp;The front-end layer is accessed by the end-user and provides APIs for the management of data storage. The middleware layer performs functions such as data de-duplication and replication of data. The back-end layer is where the hardware is implemented.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cloud storage is made of distributed resources. It is highly fault-tolerant through redundancy, consistent with data replication, and highly durable. Widely used object storage services include Amazon S3, Oracle Cloud Storage and Microsoft Azure Storage, Open Stack Swift, etc.</p></div>
