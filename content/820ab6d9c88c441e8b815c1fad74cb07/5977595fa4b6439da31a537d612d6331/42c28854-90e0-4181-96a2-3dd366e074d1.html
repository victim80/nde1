As these devices are powered by microprocessors, they are unable to handle the complexity of Internet connectivity and should not be utilized for front-line duty in IoT applications.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Smart devices are secure and robust. They have embedded security features and can handle security, encryption, authentication, etc. Hence, smart devices should be used for front-line duty in IoT applications.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security advantage of processing at the edge:&nbsp;</strong>Smart IoT devices have an edge processing feature that processes data locally before sending the data to the cloud, thus eliminating the need to forward a large quantity of data to the cloud. Edge processing enhances security by processing the data, packing the data into separate packets, and sending the data securely to the desired location. It allows users to keep sensitive information with them.</li></ul><p><strong>IoT Security Principles on the Communication Layer</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Initiate a connection to the cloud but not from the cloud</strong>: Instead of connecting IoT devices with the Internet, they should be connected to the cloud. Incoming connections should be disallowed. Connection to the cloud establishes a bi-directional channel, through which the user can control the IoT device remotely.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Inherent security of a message</strong>: All communications with IoT devices should be carefully handled. The user must enforce lightweight message-based protocols for IoT devices that consist of options for double encryption, filtering, queuing, etc. With proper labeling, the messages will be handled securely. For example, double encryption secures client data when the data pass through the message switch.</li></ul><p><strong>IoT Security Principle on the Cloud Layer</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Identification, authentication, and encryption for machines, rather than humans</strong>: Users access cloud services with a password. Occasionally, cloud services use two-factor authentication consisting of a password and a one-time password generator. For humans, passwords are the accepted method of authentication, but machines handle digital certificates while accessing cloud services. The system of digital certificates is used not only to authenticate transactions but also to encrypt the channel from the device to the cloud before the transaction. The cryptographic identification provided by the digital certificate cannot be achieved with a user ID and password.</li></ul><p><strong>IoT Security Principle on the Process Layer</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Security of remote control and updates</strong>: The remote control of an IoT device allows the user to perform remote diagnostics of the device, set new configurations, retrieve files, etc. The key to secure updates and remote control is to ensure that incoming connections to the device are disallowed; however, the device should establish a secure bi-directional connection with the cloud and utilize a message switch as a communication channel.</li></ul></div>
