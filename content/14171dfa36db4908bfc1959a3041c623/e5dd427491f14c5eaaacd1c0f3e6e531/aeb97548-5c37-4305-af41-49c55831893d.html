Many organizations have their APs placed across their interior spaces. Every AP requires installation at a specific location and angle since their installation at random locations will restrict the network performance. In addition, the coverage area needs to be planned wisely. Overlap is good. Care must be taken to not create dead-zones.</p></div>
