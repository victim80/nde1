It comes as part of the system’s OS. For example, Microsoft Firewall that is part of Windows system, Iptables, Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), etc. The different levels of traffic analysis of these firewalls include packet analysis at the network and transport layers of the OSI model. These firewalls check the MAC address, IP address, packet source, and destination port before allowing a packet to pass. Then, a stateful filter validates the packets. In the end, the packet is validated at the application layer.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Provides security for devices irrespective of change in location</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Provides internal security and avoids internal attacks by allowing only authorized users</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Setup requires basic hardware/software installation</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Useful for individuals and small businesses with fewer devices as they provide customized protection</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Provide flexibility by allowing applications and virtual machines (VMs) to take their host-based firewalls along with them when they are moved between cloud environments</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Allows configuring a single device for an individual’s requirements using custom firewall rules</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Not suitable for larger networks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Provide less security because if an attacker can access a host, they can turn off the firewall or install malicious code undetected by the organization</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Must be replaced if bandwidth exceeds firewall throughput or, otherwise, more effort are needed to scale up every device if the number of hosts increase</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Costly, as they require individual installation and maintenance on every server for big organizations</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dedicated IT staff is needed for maintaining each device</li></ul><h4><strong>Network-based Firewalls</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">A network-based firewall is a hardware-based firewall that can be used to filter inbound/outbound traffic on internal LAN. For example, pfSense, Smoothwall, CISCO SonicWall, Netgear, ProSafe, D-Link, etc. Such a firewall functions on the network level and filters data that traverses through the network, forming a network perimeter as the first line of defense. It functions by routing traffic to proxy servers, which manage data transmission in the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Network-based firewalls do not require individual installation and maintenance on every server.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As any malicious traffic would exist at the network barrier, they can provide greater security than what host-based firewalls can provide a host.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They allow scalability when a client’s bandwidth demands increase.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They offer high availability (uptime) and their security can be extended beyond a single service provider network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They require a limited workforce that may be needed to manage one or two sets of network firewalls.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They are appropriate for SMEs or organizations with large networks.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">They do not consider applications and vulnerabilities on a system/VM.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They do not provide protection for host-to-host communication in the same VLAN.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Their setup requires highly skilled resources.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Their cost is lower in the case of big organizations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Incorrect maintenance of network firewalls that function as proxy servers may decrease network performance.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is recommended to configure both a host and network-based firewall for best protection</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the real environment, a combination of host-based and network-based firewalls provides greater security. For example, if an attacker were able to breach the network-level security, it would still be difficult to breach each host-based firewall. This combination is suitable for big organizations with complex networks, which have higher threat levels to their sensitive data and need to meet the strong compliance standards.</p></div>
