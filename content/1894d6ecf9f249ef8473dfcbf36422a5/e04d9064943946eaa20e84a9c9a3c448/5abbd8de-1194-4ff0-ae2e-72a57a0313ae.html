  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Continuous power consumption/supply can cause data centers, hardware, and equipment to become hot very quickly. Furthermore, improper equipment placement can increase the risk of fire. The HVAC is a special system that controls the environment in a room or building, especially the humidity conditions of the air and ventilation. It is deployed to maintain comfortable temperatures in a room so that the hardware is not affected by moisture and changes in the air. In these controlled conditions, the hardware and components are also safer and less prone to damage due to environmental factors. The HVAC also purifies the air in rooms and removes smoke, odor, heat, and dust particles. An environment where the air is odor-free and clean and the humidity is controlled provides a good atmosphere for the people working with that organization. These ventilation systems are desired mostly in medium- to large-scale organizations that use heavy equipment and employ a large number of people. A pre-programmed sensing device is used to check for changes in the temperature, and the HVAC acts accordingly. The HVAC can also be manually controlled. Before installing the HVAC equipment, the organization must consider various factors and components such as hardware, cabling, fire protection, and power supply. Baseline temperature and humidity levels must be maintained to keep equipment working reliably. Equipment that emits hot or cold air should be continuously monitored.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">When a refrigeration component is added to an HVAC system, it is known as an HVAC&amp;R or HVACR (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning &amp; refrigeration) system.</p><h4 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Types of HVAC Systems</strong></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heating and air-conditioning split system</strong>: The traditional and most commonly used HVAC system is the heating and air-conditioning split system. The components of this system may be found both inside and outside the building. HVAC split systems have the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">An air conditioner to cool the refrigerant</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Furnaces, a fan, or an evaporator coil for converting the refrigerant and circulating the air</li><li style="text-align:justify;">A duct to allow air flow throughout the building</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Air-quality fittings such as air cleaners and air purifiers</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hybrid heat split system</strong>: This is an advanced version of a split system having better energy efficiency. In this system, the heat pump realizes an electrically fueled HVAC instead of gas furnace heat. A typical hybrid heat split system includes the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">A heat pump to cool/heat the refrigerant</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Furnaces or an evaporator coil to convert the refrigerant and circulate the air</li><li style="text-align:justify;">A duct to allow air flow throughout the building</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Controls or a thermostat as an interface to control the system</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Air-quality fittings such as air cleaners and air purifiers</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duct-free split heating and air-conditioning system</strong>: Most commonly used in locations where traditional split systems cannot be used, a typical duct-free split system includes the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">An air conditioner to cool the refrigerant</li><li style="text-align:justify;">A fan coil to convert the refrigerant and circulate the air</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Refrigerant tubing and wires to connect the outdoor unit to the fan coil</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Controls or a thermostat as an interface to control the system</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Air-quality fittings such as air cleaners and air purifiers</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packaged heating and air-conditioning system</strong>: This is the most effect air-conditioning system and is used mainly in locations with adequate space for fixing all the components of a split system. Packaged units can be used in spaces that range from an entire building to one-room units. A packaged heating and air-conditioning system includes the following components:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Packaged products such as a heat pump or an air conditioner combined with a fan coil or an evaporator coil in a single unit</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Controls or a thermostat as an interface to control the system</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Air-quality fittings such as air cleaners and air purifiers.</li></ul><p><br></p></div>
