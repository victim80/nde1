  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 6.27: Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Compliance</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A clear understanding of the requirements of an organization and how compliance is achieved can enable the organizations to benefit from business agility and growth. Compliance failure can lead to regulatory fines, lawsuits, cyber security incidents, and reputational damage.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Following are the compliance considerations for an organization to integrate its compliance programs with its cloud providers.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowing the requirements that impact an organization</strong> is important. These requirements are based on the jurisdiction of an organization, industry, or the activities employed by an organization for its operation.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Conducting regular compliance risk assessments</strong> helps organizations to establish the foundation of a strong compliance program. This process allows organizations to adopt the updated and revised risk assessment processes regularly.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Monitoring and auditing the compliance program of an organization proactively</strong> or before a crisis hits can help organizations to find gaps and improve their compliance position.</li></ul><p><strong>Data Storage Security</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In a cloud, data are stored on internet-connected servers in data centers, and it is the responsibility of data centers to secure the data. However, customers should protect their data to ensure comprehensive data security</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data Storage Security Techniques:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Local data encryption:&nbsp;</strong>Ensuring confidentiality of sensitive data in the cloud.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key management:</strong> Generating, using, protecting, storing, backing up, and deleting encryption keys. Key management in cloud ensures strict key security owing to the increased possibility of key exposure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strong password management:&nbsp;</strong>Using strong passwords and changing them at regular intervals.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Periodic security assessment of data security controls:&nbsp;</strong>Continuously monitoring and reviewing the implemented data security controls.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloud data backup:&nbsp;</strong>Taking local backups of the cloud data prevents possible data loss in the organization.</li></ul><p><strong>Network Security</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:  top;">Main challenge in cloud network security includes the lack of network visibility in monitoring and managing suspicious activities by the consumer. Cloud network security requires the following additional security features in comparison to the traditional network security features.</p><ul><li>Encrypt data-in-transit</li><li>Provide multi-factor authentication</li><li>Install firewalls</li><li>Enable data loss prevention</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;vertical-align:  top;">Methods to secure a cloud network</p><ul><li>Using DMZs</li><li>Isolating resources with subnets, firewalls, and routing tables</li><li>Securing DNS configurations</li><li>Limiting inbound/outbound traffic</li><li>Securing accidental exposures</li><li>Intrusion detection and prevention systems</li><li>Implementing layers of firewall</li></ul><p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Cloud monitoring is required to manage cloud-based services, applications, and infrastructure. Effective cloud monitoring helps an organization to protect a cloud environment from potential threats, store, and transfer data in the cloud easily and safeguard the personal data of customers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Activity monitoring should observe the following activities to monitor unauthorized data access:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data replication</strong>: It plays a key role in data management by migrating databases online and synchronizing the data in real time. Migration monitoring should be performed during data replication.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data file name changes</strong>: Data handling activities such as data file name changes should be monitored. The file change attributes should be utilized for monitoring changes in the file system.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>File classification changes</strong>: Activity monitoring through file classification changes helps in determining any changes in the cloud data files.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data ownership changes</strong>: Data activity monitoring via data ownership changes should be closely monitored to prevent unauthorized access and security breach.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Data monitoring should define thresholds and rules for normal activities, which can help in detecting unusual activities and send alerts to data owners if any breach is observed in the defined threshold.</p><p><strong>Logging</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security logs provide a record of the activities in the IT environment of an organization. They are used for threat detection, data analysis, and compliance audits to enhance cloud security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">After the accelerated adoption of cloud platforms, instead of using a few servers, companies now maintain thousands of servers that play a smaller role within the application infrastructure stack. This complicates the aggregation of data silos.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To ensure efficient and secure log management in the cloud, organizations should follow the following practices.</p><ul><li>Aggregate All Logs</li><li>Capture Appropriate Data</li><li>Keep Applications Safe</li><li>System Scalability</li></ul></div>
