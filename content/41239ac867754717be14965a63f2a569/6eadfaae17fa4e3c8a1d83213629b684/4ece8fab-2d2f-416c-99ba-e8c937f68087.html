  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.copyright.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The DMCA is an American copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO): the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. In order to implement US treaty obligations, the DMCA defines legal prohibitions against circumvention of the technological protection measures employed by copyright owners to protect their works, and against the removal or alteration of copyright management information. The DMCA contains five titles:</p><p><strong>Title I</strong>: <strong>WIPO TREATY IMPLEMENTATION</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Title I implements the WIPO treaties. First, it makes certain technical amendments to US law in order to provide the appropriate references and links to the treaties. Second, it creates two new prohibitions in Title 17 of the U.S. Code—one on circumvention of the technological measures used by copyright owners to protect their works and one on tampering with copyright management information—and adds civil remedies and criminal penalties for violating the prohibitions.</p><p><strong>Title II: ONLINE COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT LIABILITY LIMITATION</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Title II of the DMCA adds a new section 512 to the Copyright Act to create four new limitations on liability for copyright infringement by online service providers. A service provider bases these limitations on the following four categories of conduct:</p><ul><li>Transitory communications</li><li>System caching</li><li>The user-directed storage of information on systems or networks</li><li>Information location tools</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">New section 512 also includes special rules concerning the application of these limitations to nonprofit educational institutions.</p><p><strong>Title III: COMPUTER MAINTENANCE OR REPAIR</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Title III of the DMCA allows the owner of a copy of a program to make reproductions or adaptations when necessary to use the program in conjunction with a computer. The amendment permits the owner or lessee of a computer to make or to authorize the making of a copy of a computer program in the course of maintaining or repairing that computer.</p><p><strong>Title IV: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Title IV contains six miscellaneous provisions. The first provision announces the Clarification of the Authority of the Copyright Office; the second grants exemption for the making of “ephemeral recordings”; the third promotes study by distance education; the fourth provides an exemption for Nonprofit Libraries and Archives; the fifth allows Webcasting Amendments to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings, and, finally, the sixth provision addresses concerns about the ability of writers, directors and screen actors to obtain residual payments for the exploitation of motion pictures in situations where the producer is no longer able to make these payments.</p><p><strong>Title V: PROTECTION OF CERTAIN ORIGINAL DESIGNS</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Title V of the DMCA, entitles the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act (VHDPA). This act creates a new system for protecting the original designs of certain useful articles that make the article attractive or distinctive in appearance. For purposes of the VHDPA, “useful articles” are limited to the hulls (including the decks) of vessels no longer than 200 feet.</p></div>
