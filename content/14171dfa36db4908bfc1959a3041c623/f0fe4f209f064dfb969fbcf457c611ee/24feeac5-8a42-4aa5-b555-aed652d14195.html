  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A wireless network SSID can either be broadcast or hidden. By broadcasting the SSID, anyone can find and access it. If the SSID is hidden, the user has to know the exact SSID in order to connect to the wireless network. Security professionals should always disable SSID broadcasting on their devices.</p><p><strong>SSID Broadcast in the Enabled State</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">By enabling the SSID broadcast, the wireless router will broadcast its presence and name. When scanning for available wireless connections, if the SSID is broadcast, the name and presence of the network will be identified. It may be locked with a password, but anyone will be able to see it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SSID Broadcast in the Disabled State</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the SSID broadcast is disabled, then the wireless router will broadcast its presence, but will not display the name. Instead “unnamed network” will be displayed as a connection present within a user’s range. The user can connect to the wireless network after naming it and providing it with the correct authentication credentials.</p></div>
