Before implementing a VPN, ensure that a good firewall is installed. A firewall can allow or deny the flow of data through the network. Firewalls should be configured to restrict open ports as well as the types of packets and protocols that are allowed to pass through to the VPN. They are also used to terminate VPN sessions. Firewalls generally help in protecting the network from attackers. Firewalls can be used in the following two ways with a VPN.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The VPN server is connected to the Internet, and the firewall is located between the VPN server and intranet.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Here, packet filters are added to allow only VPN traffic to and from the IP address of the VPN server.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">A firewall is attached to the Internet, and the VPN server is located between the firewall and intranet.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Here, the firewall has input and output filters on the Internet interface to maintain traffic and the passage of traffic to the VPN server.</li></ul></div>
