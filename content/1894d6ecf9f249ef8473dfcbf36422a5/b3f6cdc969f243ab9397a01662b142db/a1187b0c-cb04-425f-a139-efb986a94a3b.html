  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations are at a risk of the following types of physical security threats.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Natural/Environmental Threats</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Floods</strong>: Floods commonly occur because of heavy rains or the melting of ice. Floods may affect electrical systems and server rooms in an organization. Server rooms located in the basement have a greater chance of being affected by floods.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fires</strong>: Fires mainly occur because of short circuits or poor building materials. They may affect the operational facility and computer rooms in an organization. Fires can damage the hardware, cabling system, and other important components.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Earthquakes</strong>: An earthquake is the sudden release of stored energy in the Earth’s crust that creates seismic waves. It disrupts the physical infrastructure in an organization. It damages computers and other hardware devices and documents in the sensitive areas inside an organization. Moreover, it can affect the safety or security of the organization. Earthquakes mainly affect the cabling, the wiring system, and the physical building itself. Any damage to the cabling system affects the working of the computer systems.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lightning and thunder</strong>: Lighting and thunder occur because of environmental changes. It necessitates the shutdown of all outdoor activities. Lightning and thunder lead to power and voltage fluctuations that, in turn, affect the working of systems. In particular, it may affect the memory chips and other hardware components of a system. It may lead to a short circuit in the cabling and other wiring systems if they are not covered properly. The information system may stop working with one lightning strike. Lightning may damage all electrical and electronic appliances and lead to the loss of all sensitive information.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Temperature and humidity</strong>: Computer systems operate in a certain range of temperatures; otherwise, they function in an inappropriate manner. Computer systems do not work well in hot areas and may become damaged if the temperature increases or decreases by extreme amounts. Although every computer has cooling systems, the performance of a computer still depends on the exterior temperature conditions. Furthermore, electrical and electronic appliances in an organization may be affected by a change in humidity. A high humidity leads to issues such as corrosion and short-circuits and damages magnetic tapes and optical storage media. A low humidity affects electronic devices mainly through electric discharge.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Man-made Threats</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The most significant threat to physical components and the network is from man-made errors, both intentional and unintentional. There is a wide range of such possibilities, including hackers/crackers, theft, fire, and human error. Some examples of human error that may lead to man-made threats are the unintentional pressing of an incorrect button and unplugging of the wrong device. Typical man-made threats include mechanical errors, electrical disturbance, pollution, radio-frequency interference, and explosion.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Vandalism</strong>: Disgruntled employees or former employees may attempt to compromise a system by willingly breaking or harming system components. During civil unrest or a disaster, there is a chance of systems being mishandled.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Device loss</strong>: Unauthorized access may lead to the loss of important information and devices. Device theft is a concern if devices are not properly secured.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Damage to physical devices</strong>: Improper device maintenance activities such as the improper handling of a device or information, failure to replace damaged devices, and poor cabling can damage physical devices to a great extent.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Theft</strong>: Lack of proper security and locks may result in equipment theft.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Terrorism</strong>: Terrorism activities such as the planting of a vehicle bomb, human bomb, or postal bomb in and around the organization’s premises impact physical security in many ways.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Social engineering</strong>: Social engineering is defined as an illegal act of acquiring personal information from people. An attacker can gain unauthorized physical access by performing social engineering on an organization’s employees.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Unauthorized access to systems</strong>: Both internal and external users can attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system or information about the organization.</li></ul></div>
