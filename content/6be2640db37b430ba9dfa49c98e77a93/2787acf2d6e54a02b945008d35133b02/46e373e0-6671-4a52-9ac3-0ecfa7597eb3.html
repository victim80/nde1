  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">While containerization provides fast and continuous delivery of applications to developers and DevOps teams, there are certain security challenges associated with it. The primary security challenges for containers are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Inflow of Vulnerable Source Code</strong>: Since containers<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are open source<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the images that are created by the developers are frequently updated, stored, and used as needed. This causes an inflow of source code that may potentially harbor vulnerabilities and unexpected behaviors, into an organization.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Large Attack Surface:</strong> In cloud or on-premises, there are many containers than run on multiple machines. This provides a large attack surface, and therefore causes challenges in the tracking and detection of anomalies.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lack of Visibility:</strong> The abstraction layer created by the container engine masks the activity of a particular container.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>DevOps Speed:</strong> On average, the lifespan of a container is four times less than virtual machines. Containers can be created instantly, run for a short duration of time, stopped, and removed. Due to this ephemerality, an attacker can execute an attack and disappear quickly.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Noisy Neighboring Containers:</strong> The behavior of one container can potentially cause a DOS for another container. For example, opening sockets frequently can freeze up the host machine.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Container Breakout to the Host:</strong> Containers that run as the root user can breakout and access the hostâ€™s operating system.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network-based Attacks:</strong> A jeopardized container is vulnerable to network-based attacks, especially in outbound networks with unrestricted raw sockets.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bypassing isolation/Lack of isolation</strong>: Any inadequacy in the isolation between containers can be a security challenge since an attacker who compromises one container can then easily access another container in the same host.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ecosystem complexity</strong>: The tools utilized to build, deploy, and manage containers are provided by different sources. Therefore, a user should keep the components secure and up-to-date.</li></ul></div>
