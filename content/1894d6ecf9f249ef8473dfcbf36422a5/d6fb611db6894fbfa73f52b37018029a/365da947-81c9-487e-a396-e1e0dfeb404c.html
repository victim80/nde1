While planning and designing the site architecture, an organization should prepare a list of all of its assets in the facility.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The organization should consider the following points while designing the infrastructure and architecture.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Decide the number of entrances required for the building, including the main entrance, staircase, parking, lift, hallway, and reception area.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Find the neighboring facilities around the site location and check the internal and external architecture for them. Talk to the supervisors or owners of the buildings to gain additional insights about the surroundings.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Analyze the assets that can be impacted by catastrophic failures as well as the visibility of assets to outsiders.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Consider the joint tenancy factor; if the facility is shared with other companies, consider their impact on the organizationâ€™s sensitive information and critical assets.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Identify the necessary critical infrastructure that is required for managing the physical security, storing sensitive data, and running business operations effectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Ensure a separate location for the server and storage room.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Identify what safety measures are required for these systems.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Implement emergency exits.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Make plans to manage environmental hazards.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Define who will be responsible for managing these systems.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Establish procedures explaining how they should be protected.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use a proper sanitation system including manholes and sewers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Keep parking away from the main building.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">These critical infrastructure systems may not use standard IT for safety, performance, and reliability, but they are critical to business operations. An improper or faulty implementation of certain physical measures such as electricity, backup, storage facilities, lighting, wiring, and cooling systems can be critical to the business operations of the organization.</p></div>
