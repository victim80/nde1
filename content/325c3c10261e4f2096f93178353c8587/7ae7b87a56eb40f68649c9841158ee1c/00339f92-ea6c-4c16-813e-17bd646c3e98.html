For example, the bastion host may pass the email to an internal mail server, harmonizing with an internal name server. These internal servers are secondary bastion hosts, and they must be more organized and monitored like the bastion hosts than like internal hosts. A few services may be left enabled on these systems, but they must be configured in the same way as the bastion hosts are configured.</p><p><strong>Single-homed Bastion Host</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A single-homed bastion host is a firewall device with only one network interface. All the traffic, both incoming and outgoing, is routed through the bastion host. It tests data against security guidelines and acts accordingly.</p></div>
