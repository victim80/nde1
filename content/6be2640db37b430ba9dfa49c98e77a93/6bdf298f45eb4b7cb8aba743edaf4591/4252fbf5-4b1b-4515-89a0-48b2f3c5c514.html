  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Containers (also called software containers or virtualization engines) refer to virtualization based on an operating system, in which the kernelâ€™s operating system functionality is replicated on multiple instances of isolated user space.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This can be used, for example, in a virtual hosting environment that requires segmentation of the physical resources among multiple users to enable each user to have their own virtual space. Containers help to manage the users and their respective resources, while keeping them isolated. The containers, are monitored and managed by the administrator having full admin rights to all the containers<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Many virtualization problems are effectively resolved with containerization. In containerization, although each user space instance runs in isolation, resources are not wasted since the actual operating system runs independently of the containers. A container encapsulates an application and its dependencies in its own environment while utilizing the same resources and operating system as other containers. Compared to VMs, each container image is more easily migrated and shared because of their smaller sizes. As only one operating system is involved, a container can be easily maintained. Containers also minimize hardware costs since multiple applications run on the same hardware, increasing the utilization of the hardware.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some services and technologies that can be used to deploy and manage containers.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Containers as a service (CaaS): </strong>This refers to services that enable the deployment of containers and container management through orchestrators. Using CaaS, subscribers can develop rich, scalable containerized applications through the cloud or on-site data centers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Container Engine:</strong> A container engine can be used to create, add, and remove containers as per requirements. It manages the environment for deploying containerized applications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Container Orchestration:</strong> This refers to an automated process of managing the lifecycles of software containers and their dynamic environment. Currently available open-source container orchestrators are Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, and a commercial container orchestrator is OpenShift by Red Hat.</li></ul></div>
