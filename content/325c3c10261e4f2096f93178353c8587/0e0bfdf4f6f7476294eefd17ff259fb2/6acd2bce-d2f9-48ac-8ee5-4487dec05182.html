As shown in the above figure, if an attack signature matches with any of the signatures in the signature file database, the connection will be disconnected down from the source IP, the packet will be dropped, the activity will be logged, and an alarm will be initiated. Alternatively, the packet will be moved to the next step called the anomaly detection step.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anomaly-based IDS</strong>: An anomaly-based IDS uses statistical techniques to compare the monitored traffic with the normal traffic. This method can identify new forms of attacks that are not in the IDS signature database and issue a warning. The disadvantage of this method is issuing false positive messages, which will complicate the functioning of an administrator. In the anomaly detection step, if the attack signature matches, the connections will be disconnected from the source IP, the packet will be dropped, the activity will be logged, and an alarm will be initiated. Alternatively, the packet will be sent to stateful protocol analysis.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A stateful protocol analysis is used for detecting the deviations of the protocol state, which uses predetermined profiles based on the vendor-developed definitions of malicious activity. In the stateful protocol analysis, if the packet is matched, the connections will be disconnected from the source IP, the packets will be dropped, the activity will be logged, and an alarm will be initiated. Alternatively, the packet will be passed to the network through a switch.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS performs an evaluation of a network traffic for illegal activities and policy violations. It performs a vulnerability assessment for ensuring the security of the network. The following are the features of IDS:</p><ul><li>Evaluating system and network activities</li><li>Analyzing vulnerabilities in a network</li><li>Measuring the system and file reliability</li><li>Skill to identify the possibilities of attacks</li><li>Monitoring irregular activities in a network and system</li><li>Evaluating the policy violations</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations can identify the presence of attacks or intrusions from outside a network as well as the intrusions or misuse within that network. An IDS generally performs a vulnerability assessment or scanning in order to identify the vulnerabilities in a network and to monitor the security of the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Firewalls prevent intrusions within a network, but do not actually issue an alert regarding an intrusion or an attack. On the other hand, IDS systems can monitor and identify the intrusions within a network as well as signal an alarm to the administrator.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages of IDS</strong>:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">An IDS allows continuous monitoring and tracking of all intrusions and attacks in a network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An IDS provides an extra layer of security to a network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">An IDS can also provide a log or data regarding the attack or intrusion that can be later used for investigating the incident.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">IDS requires more maintenance as compared to firewalls.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of IDS:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">It is not always possible for an IDS to detect intrusions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">IDS requires properly trained and experienced users to maintain it.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">IDS can raise false alarms to the network administrator.</li></ul></div>
