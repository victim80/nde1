  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Network address translation separates IP addresses into two sets and enables the LAN to use these addresses for internal and external traffic, respectively. A NAT helps hide an internal network layout and forces connections to go through a choke point. It works with the help of a router, helping to send packets and modifying them. When the internal machine sends the packet to the outside machine, NAT modifies the source address of the particular packet to make it appear as if it is coming from a valid address. Similarly, when the outside machine sends the packet to the internal machine NAT modifies the destination address to turn the visible address into the correct internal address. It limits the number of public IP addresses an organization can use. It can act as a firewall filtering technique where it allows only those connections which originate on the inside network and will block the connections which originate on the outside network. NATs can also modify the source and destination port numbers. NAT systems use different schemes for translating between internal and external addresses:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Assigning one external host address for each internal address and always applying the same translation. This slows down connections and does not provide any savings in address space.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Dynamically allocating an external host address without modifying the port numbers at the time when the internal host initiates a connection. This restricts the number of internal hosts that can simultaneously access the Internet to the number of available external addresses.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Creating a fixed mapping from internal addresses to externally visible addresses and using port mapping so that multiple internal machines use the same external addresses.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Dynamically allocating a pair of external host address and port each time an internal host initiates a connection. This makes the most efficient possible use of the external host addresses.</li></ul></div>
