NIDS is typically placed at boundaries between networks, behind network perimeter firewalls, routers, VPN, remote access servers, and wireless networks.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">HIDS is installed on a specific host and is used to monitor, detect, and analyze events occurring on that host. It monitors activities related to network traffic, logs, process, application, file access, and modification on the host. HIDS is normally deployed for protecting very sensitive information that is kept on publicly accessible servers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hybrid Intrusion Detection Systems (Hybrid IDS)</h3><p style="text-align:justify;">A hybrid IDS is a combination of both HIDS and NIDS. It combines the advantages of both the low false-positive rate of a NIDS and the anomaly-based detection of a HIDS to detect unknown attacks. It has its agent installed on almost every host in the network, and it has the ability to work online with encrypted networks and storing data on a single host.</p></div>
