  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Network segmentation can be implemented in three ways, namely, physical segmentation, logical segmentation, and virtualization, wherein the network is isolated physically, isolated logically (through virtual local area networks or VLANs), and entirely virtualized, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Physical Segmentation</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Physical segmentation is a process of splitting a larger network into smaller physical components. These segments can communicate via intermediary devices such as switches, hubs, or routers. Physical segmentation is generally used for isolating two or more devices from each other. For instance, all web servers are separated and placed in one segment, with database servers and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers in two other segments; these segments communicate only through their individual switches. Physical network segmentation can be an easy approach to divide a network, but it is expensive as it occupies more space and creates unwanted issues such as traffic conflicts. It is also known to be a secure mechanism but is difficult to implement as each segment in the network should have individual network connections, physical cabling, and firewall implementations.</p></div>
