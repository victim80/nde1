  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is the simplest method to use centralized authentication in VPNs. RADIUS is a client/server protocol that authenticates and authorizes dial-in-users to access the system or device. It is a software application that runs on a server and has access to all users in the domain. RADIUS maintains profiles in their databases that enable the remote servers to share the data as well as a centralized administration of data. Companies using a VPN network implement RADIUS for data authentication. This reduces the total cost of ownership because the credentials are managed from a central location.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In RADIUS, the VPN server interacts with the RADIUS server once the user attempts a connection. The RADIUS server authenticates the user with their credentials. The user is granted access if and only if the user provides the correct credentials and has dial-in access. The RADIUS server sends a RADIUS message to the RADIUS client in response to the request for authentication. The VPN equipment must securely communicate with the RADIUS server and verify whether the user meets certain set conditions before granting permission to access the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The RADIUS messages are sent as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages, and the UDP payload of a RADIUS packet can include only one RADIUS message.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are different types of RADIUS message.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Access-request:</strong> Sent by the RADIUS client to request authentication</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Access-accept:</strong> Sent by the RADIUS server in response to the access-request message</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Access-reject:</strong> Sent by access-server to the RADIUS client, informing them that the connection request is rejected</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Access-challenge:</strong> Sent by the RADIUS server to the RADIUS client in response to the access-request from the client</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Accounting–request:</strong> Sent by the RADIUS client to request information for a permitted connection</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Accounting–response:</strong> Sent by the RADIUS server in response to the accounting-request message from the RADIUS client</li></ul></div>
