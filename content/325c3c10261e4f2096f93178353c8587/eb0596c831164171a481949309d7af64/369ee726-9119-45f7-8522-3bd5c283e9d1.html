PPP and SSH are built-in with most distributions, and most kernels are pre-configured to utilize them well. If the SSH protocol presently crosses the organization’s firewall, then PPP over SSH will cross the firewall as well. PPP-SSH VPNs do not have any problems with dynamic IP addresses.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Setting up a VPN over a dialup connection will not be a problem in the case of PPP-SSH VPNs, and multiple tunnels to a single computer can be set up. The user must ensure that the IP address for each tunnel’s network interface is discrete. For establishing SSH connections, a VPN client and servers are required. Both the client and server have PPP daemons that communicate through the SSH connection.</p></div>
