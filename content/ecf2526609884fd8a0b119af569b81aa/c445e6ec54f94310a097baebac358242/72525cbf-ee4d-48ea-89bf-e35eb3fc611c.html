  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are various types of DLP solutions that function differently with the same objective, that is, to prevent data leakage.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Endpoint DLP:</strong> Endpoint DLP is a solution that monitors and protects PC-based systems such as tablets, laptops, etc. It is used for preventing data leakage through clipboards, removable devices, and sharing applications. The solution includes an agent that monitors specific user operations such as sending an email, copying a file to removable media devices, printing a file, etc. Endpoint DLP protects data in use.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network DLP:</strong> Network DLP is a solution that monitors, protects, and reports all data in transit. It is installed at the “perimeter” of an organization’s network. It helps the security professional in scanning all data moving through the ports and protocols within the organization. It may analyze email traffic, social media interactions, SSL traffic, instant messaging, etc. The solution maintains reports containing information such what data is used, who is using the data, and where the data is sent. Thus, it helps in controlling the flow of data over the organization's network and meets regulatory compliance. Data collected by a Network DLP is stored in a database for retrieval later.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Storage DLP: </strong>Storage DLP is a solution that monitors and protects data at rest, that is, the data stored in an organization’s data center infrastructure such as file servers, SharePoint, and databases. It identifies the location where sensitive information is stored and helps users in determining whether it is stored securely. It allows authorized users to view and share sensitive files in the organization’s network.</li></ul></div>
