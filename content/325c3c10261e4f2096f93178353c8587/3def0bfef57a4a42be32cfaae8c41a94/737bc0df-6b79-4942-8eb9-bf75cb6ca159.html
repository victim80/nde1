  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS does not have the capability to make a decision, instead it maintains a database of attack signatures and patterns. Security professionals should exercise their own judgment when evaluating security alerts because an IDS does not have the ability to make these kinds of decisions. However, an IDS can use a list of previously detected signatures, which are stored in the attack signature database, to detect suspicious activity. The IDS compares the signature of packets in the network traffic with the database of known attack signatures. The IDS blocks the traffic if a packet matches a stored signature in the database. Always keep the database updated to detect new types of attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS uses normal traffic logs to match against currently running network traffic to identify suspicious activity. If it identifies unusual traffic activity, it determines the traffic to be suspicious and blocks it before it enters the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>: You need to periodically update the IDS attack signature database.</p></div>
