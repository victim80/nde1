Examples of cloud solutions include Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, and Salesforce.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The characteristics of cloud computing that attract many businesses to adopt the cloud technology are discussed below.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>On-demand self-service:</strong> A type of service rendered by cloud service providers that provides on-demand cloud resources such as computing power, storage, and network, without the need for human interaction with service providers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Distributed storage:&nbsp;</strong>Distributed storage in cloud offers better scalability, availability, and reliability of data. However, it can potentially involve security and compliance concerns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rapid elasticity:&nbsp;</strong>The cloud offers instant provisioning of capabilities to rapidly scale up or down according to demand. The resources available for provisioning to the consumers seem to be unlimited that can be purchased invariably in the desired quantity.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automated management:</strong> By minimizing user involvement, cloud automation speeds up the processes, reduces labor costs, and reduces the possibility of human error.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Broad network access:</strong> Cloud resources are available over the network and can be accessed through standard procedures via a wide variety of platforms, including laptops, mobile phones, and PDAs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resource pooling:</strong> The cloud service provider pools all the resources together to serve multiple customers in a multi-tenant environment, wherein the physical and virtual resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned on demand by the consumers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Measured service:&nbsp;</strong>Cloud systems employ the “pay-per-use” metering method. Subscribers pay for the cloud services via monthly subscriptions or according to the usage of resources such as the storage levels, processing power, and bandwidth. Cloud service providers monitor, control, report, and charge the customers according to the resources consumed with complete transparency.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Virtualization technology:&nbsp;</strong>It enables the rapid scaling of resources in such a way that could not be achieved by non-virtualized environments.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Limitations of Cloud Computing</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Organizations have limited control and flexibility</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Prone to outage and other technical issues</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Security, privacy, and compliance issues</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Contracts and lock-ins</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dependence on network connections</li></ul></div>
