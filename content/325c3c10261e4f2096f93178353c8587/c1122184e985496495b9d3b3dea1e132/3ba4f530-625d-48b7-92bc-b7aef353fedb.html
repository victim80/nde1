  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A response system in an IDS is responsible for the countermeasures when an intrusion is detected. These countermeasures include logging out the user, disabling a user account, blocking the source address of the attacker, restarting a server or service, closing connections or ports, and resetting TCP sessions. You also need to involve in the decision during incident response and should have the ability to respond on your own. You need to make decisions on how to deal with false positives and when a response needs escalation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Security professionals can setup an IDS to allow the response system to take actions against intrusions or they can respond on their own. In the case of false positives, administrators need to respond to allow this traffic into the network without blocking it. Using the response system, administrators can also define the level of counter action an IDS must take to respond to the situation, depending on the severity of the intrusion.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS has the advantage of providing real-time corrective action in response to an attack. It automatically takes action in response to a detected intrusion. The exact action differs per product and depends on the severity and type of attack detected. A common active response is increasing the sensitivity level of the IDS to collect additional information about the attack and the attacker. Another possible active response is making changes to the configuration of systems or network devices such as routers and firewalls to stop the intrusion and block the attacker. Security professionals are responsible for determining the appropriate response and ensuring that the response is executed.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Recommendation</strong>: You should not solely rely on an IDS response system for an intrusion response.</p></div>
