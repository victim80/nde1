  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Employees connecting to a corporate network or accessing corporate data using their own mobile devices pose security risks to an organization. Following are some security risks associated with the BYOD, CYOD, COPE, and COBO policies:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sharing confidential data on an unsecured network:</strong> Employees might access corporate data via a public network. These connections may not be encrypted and sharing confidential data via an unsecured network may lead to data leakage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data leakage and endpoint security issues:</strong> In this cloud-computing era, mobile devices are insecure endpoints with cloud connectivity. By synchronizing with organizational email or other apps, these mobile devices carry confidential information. If a device is lost, it could potentially expose all corporate data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improperly disposing of devices: </strong>An improperly disposed of device could contain a wealth of information such as financial information, credit card details, contact numbers, and corporate data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that devices do not contain any data before they are disposed or passed on to others.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Support of many different devices:</strong> Organizations allow employees to access their resources from anywhere in the world, thereby enhancing productivity and driving employee satisfaction. Support for different devices and processes can increase the cost. Employee-owned devices have limited security that operate on different platforms. This deters the capabilities of the IT department to manage and control devices in a company.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mixing personal and private data: </strong>Control over isolating business use from personal use is difficult. For example, managing employees that shop on compromised websites, use public Wi-Fi connections, or given their device to others.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lost or stolen devices: </strong>Owing to their small size, mobile devices are often lost or stolen. When an employee loses their mobile device that is used for both personal and official purposes, the organization might face a security risk because the corporate data on the lost device may be compromised.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lack of awareness:</strong> Failing to educate employees regarding these policy and security issues may compromise the corporate data stored in mobile devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ability to bypass organizational network policy rules:</strong> According to requirements, the policies imposed may differ for wired and wireless networks. The devices connected to wireless networks can bypass the network policies enforced only on wired LANs.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Infrastructure issues:</strong> These policies involve dealing with various platforms and technologies. Not all employees carry the same device. Different devices, each running different OSes and programs, have security loopholes. This can be problematic for an IT department to set up and maintain an infrastructure that supports the requirements of different devices such as managing data, security, back up, and compatibility among devices.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disgruntled employees:</strong> Disgruntled employees in an organization can misuse the corporate data stored on their mobile devices. They may also leak sensitive information to competitors.</li></ul></div>
