  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The reception area is the initial point of contact for an individual approaching the organization. The reception area can be vulnerable to physical security breaches as it provides easy access to strangers. Organizations often have regular visits from clients, the general public, invitees, etc. and require staff to greet, assist, and direct them. Receptionists should be able to recognize or identify any unusual behavior from people such as solicitors and peddlers, charity organizations, and ex-employees. The reception personnel should maintain eye contact and non-confrontational facial expressions or posture while meeting people. They should be proficient enough to handle emergency situations and follow procedures to call immediate attention, issue alarms, call for radio, administer first aid, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The reception area should be spacious and should offer the scope to control building access and visitor traffic as well as assess visitor behaviors. Reception personnel should observe people entering the building. They should notice and record odd behavior from strangers. Benchmarks should be implemented to judge people arriving at the organization. Their intentions must be noted, and the personnel should identify whether a person is searching for someone or something. Important files and documents or devices should not be kept on the reception desk. The design and placement of reception desks should help in discouraging inappropriate access to the administrative area. Computers at a reception desk should be positioned so that the screens are not visible to visitors and must always be locked when the reception personnel is away from the desk.</p></div>
