  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A storage area network (SAN) is a high performance network that interconnects storage devices with multiple servers. The role of a SAN is to transfer stored resources available on the common network and reorganize them on an independent and high-performance network. This helps the servers to share their storage across the network. Primarily, a SAN enhances storage devices such as tape drives, disk drives, file servers, RAID, etc. A SAN implementation makes disk maintenance controllable and easier. The implementation needs a cable, a switch, and host bus adapters. Each storage system on the SAN must be interconnected, and in case of a physical interconnection, the bandwidth should support extreme data activities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We know that systems in a network connect to storage devices. However, a SAN implementation is necessary to ensure that all systems in a network are connected to each available storage device on the network. SAN allows these systems to take the ownership of storage devices; systems can exchange the ownership of storage devices among themselves.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Understanding Storage Sharing</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The working of a SAN depends on client-server communication. Every organization has multiple servers that are connected to the systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: If computer A needs some data from computer B, it will need a copy of the data from the server to which computer B is connected. This can be done through file transfer, inter-process communication, and backup. Although the data is transferred from computer B to computer A, it is possible that computer A may encounter untimely data errors, an expensive transfer between the two servers, or other operational processes. SAN architecture is the perfect solution for this issue. In SAN architecture, all servers are connected to storage devices such as tape drives, RAIDs, disk systems, etc. through a fiber channel. Thus, instead of communicating with computer B for the data, computer A can directly get a copy of the data from the storage devices connected to the servers. For this process to be successful, data storage devices act as a common access point for all the servers.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">SAN storage sharing eliminates the scheduling of data transfers among servers. It reduces the cost of data transfer among servers. Storage devices help in timely transfer of data. SAN storage offers only block-level operations that do not provide file abstraction.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the file systems are structured on top of SAN, file access is provided which is known as a SAN file system.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now-a-days, in large organizations, SAN is a storage pool for servers that are connected via a network. The fiber channel is now replaced by iSCSI, which has become the choice of many mainstream organizations. Whatever be the size of the organization, SAN has become a consolidation of workloads in the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A SAN supports data archival, backup, restore, transfer, retrieval, migration, and mirroring from one storage device to another. The communication infrastructure layer provides the physical connections to the network devices. The management layer organizes the connections, storage elements, and computer systems. The storage layer hosts the storage devices.</p></div>
