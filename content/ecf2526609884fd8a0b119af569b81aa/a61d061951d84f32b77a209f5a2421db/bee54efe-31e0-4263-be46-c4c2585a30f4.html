  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">Many organizations depend on RAID technology for handling their critical backup needs, especially with the increase in data flow and data volume. Organizations are expanding their networks to improve their productivity. However, this additional increase can cause network bottlenecks. The probability of losing data because of disaster, threats, mistakes, and hardware failures hamper an organizationâ€™s ability to grow. RAID technology overcomes these situations providing an option for data availability, high performance, efficient and accessible recovery options without a loss of data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Understanding RAID Technology</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">RAID technology is used to store data in different places on several disks. Storing the data on multiple disks improves the performance of I/O operations. RAID technology functions by implementing multiple hard disks as a single logical disk. It allows a more balanced storage of the same data across an array of disks. An effective implementation of this technology helps address the complex issues in fault tolerance. The data organized in RAID levels depends on the RAID storage techniques and installation methods. Usually, the implementation of RAID is done on a server. Although personal computers do not necessarily need this technology, they can still setup and utilize it in a smaller environment than an enterprise.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">RAID has six levels for functioning effectively: RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 3, RAID 5, RAID 10, and RAID 50. Each level has the following features:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fault tolerance</strong>: Even if a disk fails to work, other disks will continue to function normally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance</strong>: RAID achieves high performance during read and write processes across multiple disks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Competence</strong>: This is defined by the amount of data stored. The storage capacity of disks depends on the chosen RAID level. The storage capacity need not be equal the size of the individual RAID disks.&nbsp;</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">All the RAID levels depend on the storage techniques listed below:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Striping</strong>: Striping divides the data into multiple blocks. These blocks are further written across the RAID system. Striping improves the data storage performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mirroring</strong>: Data mirroring makes image copies of the data and simultaneously stores this data across the RAID. This affects fault tolerance and data performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Parity</strong>: Parity uses a striping method to calculate the parity function of a data block. During a drive failure, the parity recalculates the function using a checksum method.</li></ul></div>
