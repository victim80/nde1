  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source, portable, extensible, orchestration platform developed by Google for managing containerized applications and microservices. Kubernetes provides a resilient framework to manage distributed containers, generate deployment patterns, and perform failover and redundancy for the applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kubernetes Cluster Architecture</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes nodes are worker machines, which run the containerized applications. There should be at least one worker node in a cluster. The worker nodes host the pods, which refer to groups of containers that are deployed together on the same host. The components of a Kubernetes cluster are as follows:</p><p><strong>Control Plane Components</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The components of the control plane perform decisions for the Kubernetes cluster such as scheduling or staring a new pod. The following are the control plane components of the cluster:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-apiserver</strong>: The Kubernetes control plane has an API server in its front end. Kube-apiserver is the implementation of the Kubernetes API server. The user can run multiple instances of kube-apiserver to facilitate the maintenance of the traffic between the instances.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>etcd</strong>: This is a backing store for the data in the Kubernetes cluster. For example, if the user specifies that three instances of a specific pod should be executed, this information is stored in etcd. The data stored in etcd is used to determine the number of instances that are running. If an instance is not working, Kubernetes creates an additional instance of the same pod.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-scheduler</strong>: The kube-scheduler monitors newly created pods that do not have any assigned nodes, and assigns each of them a node to run on.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>kube-controller-manager:&nbsp;</strong>Kube-controller-manager runs the controller processes. It consists of a node controller, replication controller, endpoints controller, service account, and token controllers. To minimize complexity, all these controllers are compiled and run as a single process.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>cloud-controller-manager:</strong> This runs the controller that communicates with the cloud providers. The cloud-provider-specific controller loops are run by cloud-controller-manager. When a kube-controller-manager is initialized, the user can disable the controller loops by setting the -cloud-provider flag to external. The controllers with cloud provider dependencies are node controller, route controller, service controller, and volume controller.</li></ul><p><strong>Kubernetes Node</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">A Kubernetes node is a worker machine that contains the services required to run the pods, and is managed by master components. The services on Kubernetes nodes are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kubelet:&nbsp;</strong>This is a node agent that ensures that the containers are running in a pod.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A pod contains a PodSpec, which is a YAML or JSON object. The kubelet ensures that the containers mentioned in the PodSpecs are running and healthy.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kube-proxy:&nbsp;</strong>This is a network proxy that runs and maintains network rules on each node.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Container Runtime:&nbsp;</strong>This is a software that downloads the images and runs the containers. Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as Docker, CRI-O, and the Kubernetes container runtime interface (CRI).</li></ul><p><strong>Kubernetes Features</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Service Discovery and Load Balancing</strong>: Kubernetes represent a container using the DNS or its own IP address. In case the network traffic to the container is high, Kubernetes utilizes load balancing to distribute the traffic.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Storage Orchestration</strong>: Kubernetes enables the user to choose between storage systems such as local storage, public cloud providers (AWS or GCP), or a network storage system.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks:</strong> Kubernetes enables the user to change the actual state of the container to the desired state of the container at a controlled rate.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Automatic bin packing:&nbsp;</strong>To utilize resources effectively, Kubernetes fits the containers into nodes depending on the specifications provided by the user.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Self-healing:&nbsp;</strong>Kubernetes self-heal the containers by restarting failed containers. If a node is dead, Kubernetes replaces and reschedules the containers. When a container fails to respond to user-defined health checks, Kubernetes kills the container. Kubernetes also advertises the containers that are in working condition.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secret and Configuration Management:</strong> Kubernetes enables users to store and manage confidential information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys.</li></ul></div>
