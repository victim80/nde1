This type of the host is completely a firewall, or it might be a component of a multi-faceted firewall. If the host is a firewall, one must be careful that the configuration and the bastion host’s instructions must be followed with concern.</p><p><strong>Victim Machines</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In cases where there is a necessity to run services that are not secure and certain new applications whose security flaws are not yet known; you can use a machine (a victim machine) to install them. Such machines allow any user to log in. There is no issue, even if such machines are compromised. A victim machine is disposable in the sense that it is only used for the applications with security implications and for no other purpose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Victim machines are configured in the procedure similar to a typical bastion host expecting that they will always have users to log in. It will be wise if pressures are resisted, such as the user’s desire for more services and programs than the ones that are provided on the usual bastion system. It must also be made sure that the user must not be comfortable with the victim machines, because the intended design may no longer work. The important factor that must be considered is that it is not reusable.</p><p><strong>External Services Hosts</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bastion hosts, which provide exclusive services for the Internet, have a unique concern; they are visible to everybody. This makes it vulnerable to attacks and the increased vulnerability will be prone to more successful attacks. If one of the internal services provided to the internal users is compromised, it is not obvious that the outsiders can assess the services. If one of the pages of the website is replaced, then everyone will become aware of the change and take note of it. These machines should have more security features, and they do not have minimum features to make it easier to secure. They require only minimum access privileges to the internal network.</p><p><strong>One-box Firewalls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the machine is constructed as a firewall, rather than as part of a wall, then it is more prone to attacks. The entire site’s security relies on this one machine. It is always necessary to guarantee that this machine is absolutely secure. A replica of the original system can be used to test the new configuration without risking the Internet connection.</p></div>
