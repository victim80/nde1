Logical segmentation utilizes VLANs, which are isolated logically without considering the physical locations of devices. Each VLAN is considered an independent logical unit, and the devices within a VLAN communicate as though they are in their own isolated network. This type of segmentation is easier to implement and flexible to operate. In this approach, firewalls are shared, and switches handle the VLAN infrastructure. Logical segmentation does not need new hardware, and the provided environment is managed with the existing hardware resources. This type of segmentation employs the built-in concepts incorporated within the network infrastructure such as the creation of independent VLANs that share a physical routing device (switch), segregation of various asset types into different layer-3 subnets, and use of a router to allow data exchange between subnets.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">The following are the key advantages of logical segmentation:</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It enables the creation of virtual workgroups irrespective of usersâ€™ locations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It effectively controls the network broadcast.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It improves security by defining which network nodes can interact with each other.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It eliminates the physical boundaries between users.</li></ul></div>
