  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Most organizations have offices at different locations around the world. Consequently, there is a need for establishing a remote connection between these offices. Previously, remote access was established through leased lines with the help of dial-up telephone links such as ISDN, DSL, cable modem, satellite, and mobile broadband. However, establishing remote connections with these leased lines is quite expensive, and the costs increase as the distance between the offices increases.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To overcome the drawbacks of conventional remote access technologies, organizations are adopting virtual private networks (VPNs) to provide remote access to their employees and distant offices.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A VPN offers an attractive solution for security professionals to connect their organization’s network securely over the Internet. VPN is used to connect distant offices or individual users to their organization’s network over a secure channel.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">VPN uses a tunneling process to transport encrypted data over the Internet. IPsec is the most common protocol used in VPN at the IP level. VPN ensures data integrity by using a message digest and protects data transmission from being tampered with. VPN guarantees quality of service (QoS) through service-level agreements (SLAs) with the service provider.</p></div>
