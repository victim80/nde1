The processor controls the entire functioning of the drive arrays and interfaces. It provides flexible and high-performance functions. The architecture in the figure above shows a RAID system can depend on hard disk drives (HDDs) as well as SSDs. The processor requires DRAM and NAND flash memory. The NAND flash memory provides a nonvolatile storage to the primary RAID memory cache.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A battery backup or an ultra-capacitor unit in the primary RAID memory cache is helpful when the RAID control processor suffers from a power failure. In this scenario, the battery backup independently copies the DRAM contents to the NAND flash memory. A battery backup is an inexpensive alternative during a power loss. The architecture shows the requirement of a nonvolatile memory in the RAID controller firmware, RAID journal, and transaction and error log files.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Major Components of a RAID Architecture</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RAID controller:</strong> This is either hardware- or software-based and contains the HDDs or solid state drives as a single logical unit. A RAID controller has the permission to access multiple copies of files present on multiple disks, thereby preventing damage and increasing the system performance. In a hardware RAID, a physical controller manages the RAID array with a controller in the form of a PCI card that supports SATA or SCSI. A software RAID works similarly to a hardware RAID, except that their performance is lower than the former.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Primary RAID memory cache:</strong> The RAID controller has a direct access to the cache memory, enabling faster read and write access to the storage system. The cache is used to store the changing data. The cache memory is bigger in size and uses high-speed SDRAMs. A normal cache memory has a write cache and a separate read cache. The read cache decreases the latency of the read process. There are two types of write cache memories:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Write-through mode:</strong> This bypasses the cache memory and writes the data directly to the disk after the host sends it. The host sends the next data item after receiving a confirmation that the writing process has been completed.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Write-back mode:</strong> Data sent from the host is written to the cache memory. The host may perform other actions while the RAID controller transfers data from the cache to the disk drive. The RAID controller acknowledges the write process to the host soon after writing the data to the cache. Issues may arise if a RAID controller sends an acknowledgment before the data has been completely written on the disk.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IDE, SATA, or SCSI interfaces: IDE</strong>, SATA, or SCSI are device cables that transmit read/write signals to and from the drive. These are mostly used for internally connecting the drives. Moreover, servers are connected using these interfaces.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IDE:</strong> Integrated drive electronics (IDE) allows the connection of two devices per channel. It is normally used for internal devices as the cables are large and flat.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SATA:</strong> Serial ATA deals with hot plugging and serial connectivity. The hot plugging technique may be used to replace computer components without shutting down the system. SATA enables only one connection per connector and is not flexible for industrial purposes.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SCSI:</strong> Small computer system interface (SCSI) allows multiple devices to be connected to a single port at the same time. SCSI uses a parallel cable for attaching internal and external devices.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>nvSRAM:</strong> Nonvolatile SRAM, or nvSRAM, has a faster read and write process (20 ns read and write access time) because of the presence of a standard asynchronous SRAM interface. nvSRAM ensures adequate data storage capabilities without the need for a battery during a shut down. nvSRAM is best used in applications that require high speed and nonvolatile storage at a low cost, such as in the medical industry. nvSRAM backups the data even in the event of a power failure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multiport memory controller:</strong> An MPMC provides access to memory for up to eight ports. A memory controller can be present as a separate chip or as an integrated memory. It provides access to a memory bank, and helps achieve a high efficiency with random address accesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NAND flash memory:&nbsp;</strong>Flash memory is a storage medium designed from electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). NAND and NOR are two types of flash memories. It provides a nonvolatile storage for the RAID system's primary cache. Its primary aim is to reduce cost and increase capacity. It does not require power to retain the data. It can improve its read-write cycles with reduced voltage demands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SDRAM:&nbsp;</strong>Synchronous dynamic random access memory or synchronous DRAM (sDRAM) is a memory that is synchronized with the processorâ€™s clock speed. This increases the number of instructions the processor can process. SDRAM speed is measured in Mega Hertz (MHz). It is divided into several sections called banks that allow the device to operate on several memory access commands simultaneously.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk:&nbsp;</strong>The hardware presents the RAID to the host system as a single and large disk.</p></div>
