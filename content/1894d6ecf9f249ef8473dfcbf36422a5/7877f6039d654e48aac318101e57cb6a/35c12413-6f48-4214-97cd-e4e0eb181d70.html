  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An organization should always pay attention to the security of its server and backup storage devices. At the same time, the organization should not ignore the security of other critical assets such as workstations, routers and switches, printers, other network equipment, and removable devices. The organization should employ all the physical security measures of server/backup devices for critical assets and removable devices. Furthermore, organizations must keep their network devices and computer equipment in locked cabinets. Some cabinets come with biometric locks and climate control features. Restrict the use of removable devices such as DVDs, USB pen drives, SD cards, mobile phones, and cameras. Design and implement acceptable-use policies to manage the use of removable devices. Implement a regular inventory review of removable devices. Consider using corporate-controlled locked-down devices instead of implementing a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Workstations</strong>: Workstations at unoccupied desks, empty offices, reception desk, etc. are relatively more vulnerable to physical security breaches. Disconnect or remove such unoccupied workstations or otherwise lock the doors to the room where the workstation is located.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Routers and switches</strong>: Keep these critical network devices in locked rooms.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Printers</strong>: Like servers and workstations, printers can store important information, should be bolted down, and installed at separate locations.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Removable devices</strong>: Portable removable devices such as laptops, handheld computers, mobile devices, SD cards, USB, and Bluetooth devices can pose physical security risks. Keep these devices in a drawer or safe, or permanently attach a cable lock.</li></ul></div>
