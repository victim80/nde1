  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 9.8: Schematic of an IoT-enabled environment</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the figure, the IoT things/devices layer communicates with a cloud gateway. Here, the gateway authenticates and authorizes the devices to participate in the workflow and thereby ensures secure communication between the devices and the centralized command center. Furthermore, the gateway can deal with different protocols and data formats. The devices and local gateways with different protocols (SOAP, REST, AMQP, etc.) register with the cloud gateway. Here, without considering the inbound protocol, the cloud gateway can provide a view of the device layer to the remaining IoT components.</p><p><strong>Features of an IoT-Enabled IT Environment</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following features of IoT platforms help an IT environment reach its targets quickly:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Real-time monitoring involves monitoring IoT assets, processing products, maintaining a flow, helping detect issues, and taking actions immediately.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Real-time analytics involves analyzing IoT things and taking steps accordingly. For example, it provides graphs and real-time streaming analytics, allowing the business to overview its performance and production.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Multi-layer security involves preventing unauthorized access to IoT things by using multi-factor authentication (MFA), Transport Layer Security (TLS), device identity management, etc.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Data collection involves the exchange of data between IoT-enabled organizations using different communication protocols. These protocols should be lightweight and should provide low-network-bandwidth functionality.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Communication among multiple devices involves configuring multiple devices to access IoT things even remotely at any time and from anywhere.</li></ul></div>
