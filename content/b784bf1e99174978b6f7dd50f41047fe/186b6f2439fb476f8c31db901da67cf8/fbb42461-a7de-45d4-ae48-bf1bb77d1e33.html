It helps in implementing enterprise-wide policies to reduce support costs, business discontinuity, and security risks. It helps system administrators to deploy and manage software applications across all enterprise mobile devices to secure, monitor, manage, and support these devices. It can be used to manage both company-owned and employee-owned (BYOD) devices across the enterprise.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Discussed below are various concepts related to mobile device management:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile application management</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Mobile application management (MAM) is software that is mostly used by IT admins to control and secure organizational data. MAM offers features such as the remote activation or deactivation of devices, device registration in the organization, and remote wiping in case of theft or loss. These features are suitable for mobile devices that are used only for organizational purposes by the employees. For mobile devices that are used for both work and personal use, IT admins can implement and apply privacy policies on mobile applications by limiting organizational data sharing. They can also enable the partitioning of the applications used in the organization and personal data on the same mobile devices. MAM features also include software or application distribution to employees, license management, data encryption, configuration, and inventory management.</p><p><strong>Mobile content management</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Mobile content management (MCM) is software that forms a part of mobile device management (MDM). MCM offers solutions to safeguard the content or data on the mobile devices used in an organization. It provides features to store and deliver data, offer the required services, and permit employees to access the organizational data remotely and at any time necessary. MCM ensures that unauthorized data access is restricted or blocked, thereby protecting the confidential data of the organization. It oversees critical data management, access to work documents, email management, and digital asset management. It can also encrypt confidential data and use any strong password technique for data transmission and data storage.</p><p><strong>Context-aware authentication</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Context-aware authentication is a type of enhanced security technique that uses the contextual information of a user such as geolocation, identity, and behavior for enhancing data security decisions. It also uses the data about the user, requests made, connection, and location. All this data help in preventing malicious users from accessing the organizational data. This technique also allows employees to access the organizational network within the office perimeter and denies access when a device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network.</p></div>
