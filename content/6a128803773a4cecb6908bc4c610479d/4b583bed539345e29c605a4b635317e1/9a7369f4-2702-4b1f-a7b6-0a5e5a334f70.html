If an issue occurs in the network, the root cause can be determined easily with network monitoring, and with network automation tools, the problem can be fixed automatically. Networking monitoring not only prevents outages but also gives visibility to potential issues. Continuous network monitoring minimizes downtime and increases the performance of the network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Even when security tools are in place, attackers can find ways to bypass such security mechanisms to enter the network. Security tools generally use signature-based detection techniques, and it is difficult to identify continuously changing attack signatures/patterns. These tools are not designed to identify behavioral anomalies and are unable to detect attackersâ€™ activities that are initiated before and during attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Network monitoring tools provide the first level of security and help identify anomalous conditions in the network, which indicate attacker activity.</p></div>
