  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Log collection</strong>: SIM collects and logs data from different sources such as networks, applications, devices, and user activity in real time in a central repository for analysis and reporting.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Log analysis</strong>: SEM performs the real-time monitoring and analysis of security incidents. SIEM monitors all the security policies, mechanisms (confidentiality, authentication, authorization, etc.), and devices and applications (IDS/IPS, firewall, etc.) in real time. It detects malicious activities and issues alerts about security-related events.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Event correlation</strong>: SIEM performs real-time event correlation and alerts analysts and administrators to secure the enterprise network from internal and external threats. SIEM uses rules to correlate events within a time period to understand interrelations between the events and issue alerts for intrusions and insider threats.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Log forensics</strong>: SIEM collects, logs, and tracks information from different resources in the enterprise network. Further, it performs forensic analysis and generates various forensic reports such as user activity reports, compliance reports, and audit reports.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IT compliance and reporting</strong>: SIEM ensures compliance in real time with various industry regulations such as FISMA, PCI/DSS, and HIPAA. It automatically collects the information necessary for compliance with organizational and government policies, and it generates compliance reports.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Application log monitoring</strong>: SIEM monitors log files from various OSes, servers, and web applications and generates analysis reports when security events are detected.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Object access auditing</strong>: SIEM effectively collects and manages all the object access audit logs at the central repository. This helps in tracking successful and failed attempts to access organizational resources.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Data aggregation</strong>: Using data aggregation, SIEM aggregates all similar events into one summary report. This report helps security analysts further investigate various security-related events effectively.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Real-time alerting</strong>: SIEM issues real-time notifications through methods such as intuitive dashboards, emails, or text messages to alert analysts regarding security events.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>User activity monitoring</strong>: SIEM tracks suspicious user behavior and generates user-wise activity reports. It provides user activity monitoring, privileged user activity monitoring, and audit reports.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dashboards</strong>: SIEM utilizes dashboards to inform security analysts and administrators to take defensive actions quickly and make the right decisions during security events.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>File integrity monitoring</strong>: In SIEM, file integrity monitoring ensures the real-time monitoring and integrity of confidential data to meet compliance requirements. It helps security analysts and administrators record, access, and change system files and folders such as OS files, system configuration files, installed software, and running processes. It generates reports on all changes to the system files and folders, and it issues real-time alerts when an unauthorized user attempts to access any confidential files or folders.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>System and device log monitoring</strong>: SIEM provides both the static and dynamic monitoring of enterprise systems and networks. It analyzes log data to identify suspected activities related to system compromise. It dynamically collects, correlates, and evaluates data from heterogeneous systems and devices in the network to detect attacks as early as possible before any significant damage to enterprise resources.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Log retention</strong>: SIEM stores logged data in a central repository for long periods to meet compliance and regulatory requirements and for conducting forensic analysis, investigation, and internal audits. The log data stored in the central repository are generally encrypted and time-stamped to protect the data from tampering.</li></ul></div>
