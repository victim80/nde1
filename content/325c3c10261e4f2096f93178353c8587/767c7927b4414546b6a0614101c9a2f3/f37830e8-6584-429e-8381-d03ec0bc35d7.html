The sensor placed at this location can detect inbound attacks. It can also be configured to detect outbound attacks. The sensor is configured to detect the least sensitive attacks to avoid false alarms. Such a sensor is configured to only log the attack attempts, instead of sending alerts out for them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Monitors attacks originating from the outside world</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Highlights the inability of the firewall and its policies to defend against attacks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">It can see attacks which target the web or FTP servers located in the DMZ</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Monitors outgoing traffic results from a compromised server</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Location 2</strong>: Place an IDS sensor outside an external firewall.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This location is ideal for securing the perimeter network as well as identifying those attacks that bypass the external firewall. The NIDS sensor secures web, FTP, and other servers located on the perimeter of the network. It detects attacks with low to moderate impact in order to avoid the chances of generating false alarms. Any sensor placed here also has the ability to monitor for outbound attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Ability to identify the number and types of attack originating from the Internet to the network</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Location 3</strong>: Place an IDS sensor on major <strong>network backbones.&nbsp;</strong>The sensor placed at this location is used to secure the internal network of the organization. It detects an attack may have bypassed the internal firewall. A sensor at this location is capable of detecting both inbound and outbound attacks. Such a sensor is configured to detect medium to high impact level attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Monitors and inspects large amounts of traffic, increasing the chance for attack detection</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Detects unauthorized attempts from outside the organization</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Location 4</strong>: Place an IDS sensor on critical subnets. The sensor at this location is used to protect sensitive hosts in the network, including critical servers. It is capable of detecting both inbound and outbound attacks. Such a sensor is configured to detect high impact level attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Detects attacks on critical systems and resources</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Focuses on specific critical systems and resources</li></ul></div>
