High levels of disturbance can cause severe damage such as shaky monitors, system failures, and unexplained shutdowns. EMI shielding is the practice of coating electronic equipment with metals so that electromagnetic waves do not interfere with other devices or the field is blocked with certain materials. EMI shields separate one part of the equipment from another.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Shielding uses materials such as metals or metal foams. An electric field produces a charge on the conducting material, applying an electromagnetic field on a conductor. The conductor produces another charge, which cancels the effect of the electric charge externally applied on it. This causes no change in the conducting material. When the electric field is applied to the material, it produces eddy currents (currents that flow within a material in closed loops). These currents cancel the effect of the magnetic field. In this manner, the shielded material is protected from outside effects or disturbances.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">For organizations that use heavy equipment, electronic hardware interference is a problem, and EMI shielding is needed for all devices in these types of environments. Many industries such as the telecommunication and healthcare industries prefer to use EMI shielding.</p></div>
