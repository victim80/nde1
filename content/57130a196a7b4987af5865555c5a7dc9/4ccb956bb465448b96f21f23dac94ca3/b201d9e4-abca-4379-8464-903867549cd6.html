  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align: justify;">Different types of unauthorized or illegal activities may include interrupting, damaging, exploiting, or restricting access to networks or computing resources and stealing data and information from them. The implementation of numerous security measures, by itself, does not guarantee network security. For example, many organizations assume that deploying a firewall, or multiple firewalls, on the network is sufficient to protect their infrastructure from a variety of threats. However, attackers can bypass such security measures to gain access to systems. Thus, it is important to ensure comprehensive network defense to prevent and mitigate various types of threats. The goal of comprehensive network defense is to deploy continual and defense-in-depth security, which involves predicting, protecting, monitoring, analyzing, detecting, and responding to unauthorized activities such as unauthorized access, misuse, modification, service denial, and any degradation or disruption in the network, and to guarantee the overall security of the network. Organizations rely on information assurance (IA) principles to attain defense-in-depth security.</p></div>
