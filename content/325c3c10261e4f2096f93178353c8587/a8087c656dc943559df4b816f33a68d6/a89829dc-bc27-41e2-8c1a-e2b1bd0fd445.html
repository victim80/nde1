  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS is classified based on the type of data source used for detecting intrusions. An IDS uses data sources such as audit trail and network packets to detect intrusions. Depending on the data source, an IDS can be categorized into two types: intrusion detection using audit trails and intrusion detection using network packets.</p><h4>Intrusion Detection Using Audit Trails</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">An audit trail is a set of records that provide documentary evidence of a system’s activity using the system and application processes and user activity of systems and applications. Audit trails help the IDS in detecting performance problems, security violations, and flaws in applications. Administrators should avoid storage of audit trail reports in a single file to avoid intruders from accessing the audit reports and making changes.</p><p><strong>Audit systems are used for the following:</strong></p><ul><li>Watch file access</li><li>Monitor system calls</li><li>Record commands run by user</li><li>Record security events</li><li>Search for events</li><li>Run summary reports</li></ul><p><strong>The reasons for performing audit trails are as follows:</strong></p><ul><li>Identifying the signs of an attack using event analysis</li><li>Identifying recurring intrusion events</li><li>Identifying system vulnerabilities</li><li>To develop access and user signatures</li><li>To define network traffic rules for anomaly detection-based IDSs</li><li>Provides a form of defense for a basic user against intrusions</li></ul><h4>Intrusion Detection Using Network Packets</h4><p style="text-align:justify;">A network packet is a unit of data transmitted over a network for communication. It contains control information in a header and user data. The header of the packet contains the address of the packet’s source and its destination; the payload is the body of the packet storing the original content. The header and the payload of a packet can contain malicious content sent by attackers. Capturing these packets before they enter their final destination is an efficient way to detect such attacks.</p></div>
