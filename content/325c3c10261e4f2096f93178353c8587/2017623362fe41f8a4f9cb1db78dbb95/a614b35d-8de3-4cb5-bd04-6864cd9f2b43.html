  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">An IDS generates four types of alerts: True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, and True Negative.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Positive (Attack - Alert)</strong>: A true positive is a condition that occurs when an event triggers an alarm and causes the IDS to react as if a real attack is in progress. The event may be an actual attack, in which case an attacker attempts to compromise the network, or it may be a drill, in which case security personnel use hacker tools to test a network segment.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>False Positive (No attack - Alert)</strong>: A false positive occurs if an event triggers an alarm when no actual attack is in progress. It occurs when an IDS treats regular system activity as an attack. False positives tend to make users insensitive to alarms and weaken their reactions to actual intrusion events. While testing the configuration of an IDS, administrators use false positives to determine whether the IDS can distinguish between false positives and real attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>False Negative (Attack - No Alert)</strong>: A false negative is a condition that occurs when an IDS fails to react to an actual attack event. This condition is the most dangerous failure, as the purpose of an IDS is to detect and respond to attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>True Negative (No attack - No Alert)</strong>: A true negative is a condition that occurs when an IDS identifies an activity as acceptable behavior, and the activity is acceptable. A true negative means successfully ignoring acceptable behavior. It is not harmful, as the IDS performs as expected in this case.</li></ul></div>
