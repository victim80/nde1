Security requirements include all requirements for a system to implement security policies. These are further divided into four types:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discipline Security Requirements:</strong> Actions to be taken for various components that need to be secured such as computer security, operations security, network security, personnel security, and physical security</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Safeguard Security Requirements:</strong> Protective measures required such as protective measures for access control, malware protection, audit, availability, confidentiality, integrity, cryptography, identification, and authentication</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Procedural Security Requirements:</strong> Access policies, accountability, continuity of operations, and documentation</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Assurance Security Requirements:</strong> Policies used with the compliance of various standards, certifications, and accreditations</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Policy&nbsp;</strong><strong>Description Based on Requirement</strong>: Policy description mainly focuses on the security disciplines, safeguards, procedures, continuity of operations, and documentation. Each subset of this policy describes how the systemâ€™s architecture elements will enforce security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Concept of Operation:</strong> This concept defines the roles, responsibilities, and functions of a security policy. It focuses on the mission, communications, encryption, user and maintenance rules, idle time management, privately owned versus public domain, shareware software rules, and virus protection policy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Allocation of Security Enforcement to Architecture Elements</strong>: This policy allocates computer system architecture to each system in the program.</p></div>
