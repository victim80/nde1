The selection of a wrong media device can lead to a segregation of data across different media devices. With a carefully considered plan, selecting an appropriate media will enable a better level of data backup.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Once the data is identified, it is important to choose an appropriate backup media to store the data. Backup media selection depends on the type and amount of data in the backup. At times, data backup consumes a large amount of space; consequently, an increased attention is necessary to select the best backup media for a situation, and to fulfill the organizational needs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing the best backup media is based on the following factors:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cost</strong>: Organization should have backup storage mediums that best fit their budget. The backup media should have more storage space than the data it will contain.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reliability:</strong> Organizations must be able to rely on the data stored on the backup media without fail. Organizations must select a media that is reliable and not susceptible to damage or loss.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Speed</strong>: Organizations should select backup mediums which require reduced number of human interactions during the backup process. Speed becomes a concern if the backup process cannot be completed when a machine is idle.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Availability</strong>: The unavailability of the backup medium could be an issue following data loss or data corruption. Organizations should decide on a medium that is always available.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Usability</strong>: Organizations should select a media that is easy to use. An easy media type has a greater flexibility during the backup process.</li></ul></div>
