  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some commonly used mobile connection methods.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Near-field communication (NFC):</strong> NFC covers very short distances. It employs electromagnetic induction to enable communication between devices connected within 10 cm. Although it allows a very narrow range of communication, an attacker with a specialized antenna can intercept and capture the data by jamming the traffic. This security issue may result from the improper configuration of NFC and non-encrypted data transmission.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Satellite communication (Satcom):&nbsp;</strong>Satcom is an artificial geostationary satellite that provides services across the globe, but it is much slower and more expensive than other technologies. There are many technologies that utilize satellite technology; some employ a connection to geostationary satellites, while others connect to satellites that revolve around the Earth in a low orbit, through which voice and data can be transmitted. The technology also has security concerns such as remote code execution and OS vulnerabilities.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Cellular communication:</strong> Cellular communication is based on a single network tower that serves devices located within a specific radius. They are installed in urban, suburban, and rural areas and cover a large distance. Mobile devices contain built-in antennas, which enable the device to communicate via a cellular network. Security concerns with cellular networks include location tracking, traffic monitoring, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, channel jamming attacks, and illegitimate access.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ANT:&nbsp;</strong>ANT is a wireless sensor protocol that enables communication between sensors and their controllers. This technology is used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as heart-rate or fitness monitoring equipment. It is not a Bluetooth or 802.11 wireless technology and has its own set of protocols developed for low-powered devices. It is susceptible to DoS or jamming attacks, and attackers can capture data in transit.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Universal Serial Bus (USB):&nbsp;</strong>USB enables wired communication for devices. It can be used for power supply and serial data transmission between devices. It is also designed to enable hot-swapping and improve plug-and-play features. USB ports are commonly used in mobile devices for both data transmission and power supply. It is relatively more secure than other connection methods, but disgruntled employees can use a USB device to exfiltrate data from the organization’s local network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Global Positioning System (GPS):</strong> GPS is a radio navigation and positioning system based on satellite communication. It provides information related to geolocation and timing irrespective of weather conditions on the Earth. Devices do not need to pass any data to satellites to establish a GPS connection; they only need to receive the signals from four or more satellites out of 28 to estimate their location. Security concerns with this technology include the fact that GPS signals can be intercepted and tampered with using specially designed GPS jammers.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Infrared (IR):</strong> IR is a wireless technology for transferring data between two devices in the digital form within a short range of up to 5 m. It works only when there is no physical blockage or obstacle between the two devices. It is a type of networking feature integrated within devices such as tablets and smartphones that allows them to manage infrared devices. It can also be used to transfer files between devices. Any device with infrared accessibility can be managed using the infrared feature of a mobile device.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> A Wi-Fi network connects devices within a limited (Wi-Fi enabled) area with high bandwidth. It covers a shorter distance than a cellular network. It is a common wireless technology used in homes and office buildings to connect local devices. Furthermore, a mobile device can share its Internet service with other devices by using the hotspot tethering feature based on Wi-Fi technology. If clients do not use an encrypted channel or the channel does not use an appropriate protocol, then the clients can be targeted by main-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, through which attackers can sniff the traffic between two communicating devices. Since the technology uses a set of 5 or 2.5 GHz frequencies, it can also be vulnerable to DoS attacks and frequency interferences.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Bluetooth technology covers a longer distance than NFC. It is a short-range, high-speed, and low-power wireless technology that enables communication between devices connected within the Bluetooth range. When a device enables a Bluetooth connection, it sends “pairing” requests to a certain number of devices located within range, following which the corresponding device pairs with it using the device name and ID. Security concerns with Bluetooth technology include interception, eavesdropping, DoS attacks, transmission of viruses or worms, Bluesnarfing, and Bluejacking.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5G cellular (mobile) communication:&nbsp;</strong>5G or fifth-generation communication technology is a broadband cellular network that operates at high bandwidth with low latency and provides high-speed data downloads. Some of the applications of 5G include the automobile industry, public safety, and fixed wireless access. The technology is designed to support IoT devices. Security concerns with this technology are associated with its management complexity. Attackers may attempt to take advantage of the increased number of devices connected to a 5G network to compromise and use them as botnets to paralyze the network through DDoS attacks.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point-to-point (P2P) connection:&nbsp;</strong>A P2P connection enables secure communication between two mobile devices without data encryption because they are connected through fixed paths without the interference of other devices. For example, in a scenario of mobile communication between two people, only the concerned device can hear the voice from the dialed device. Routing devices can also use this method to connect with each other by adopting the over-the-air encryption technique, which reduces the risk of eavesdropping.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point-to-multipoint connection:&nbsp;</strong>A point-to-multipoint (P2MP, PTMP, and PMP) connection allows one-to-many connections by providing multiple paths from a single location to several other locations. In this connection method, a central antenna broadcasts signals to multiple receiving antennas and devices through either time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) for bidirectional data transmission. One technology that uses PMP connections is Bluetooth, which can use the PMP method to connect one device with multiple devices such as headphones and media players. This type of connection does not provide high security or privacy, because the communication channel is broadcasted and shared.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Radio-frequency identification (RFID):</strong> RFID works on radio-frequency technology, which identifies a person or object using their tags (unique labels). RFID operates in the low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF), and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) bands. HF-RFID with a mobile device is communicated via servers by providing data history, data persistence, and data management. The RFID systems can be susceptible to attacks such as power analysis, reverse engineering, replay attacks, spoofing, sniffing, DoS, and cloning.</li></ul></div>
