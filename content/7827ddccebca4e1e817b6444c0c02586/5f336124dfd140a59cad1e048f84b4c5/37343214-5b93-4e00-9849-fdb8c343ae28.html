  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Identity and access management (IAM) is responsible for providing the right individual with the right access at the right time. It offers a role-based access control to the customers or employees of an organization for accessing critical information within the enterprise. It comprises of business processes, policies, and technologies that allow monitoring electronic or digital identities. IAM products provide the system administrators with tools and technologies for regulating user access (i.e., creating, managing, and removing access) to systems or networks based on the roles of individual users within the enterprise. Organizations generally prefer an all-in-one authentication implementation which can be extended to identity a federation. This is because the identity federation includes IAM with a single sign-on (SSO) and a centralized active directory (AD) account for a secured management.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations should ensure the correctness of data for the proper functioning of the IAM framework. An IAM framework can be divided into four areas, namely, authentication, authorization, user management, and central user repository/identity repository. All the IAM components are grouped under these four areas.</p></div>
