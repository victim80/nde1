  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Video surveillance refers to monitoring activities in and around the premises using closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems. Video surveillance is considered an important component of physical security. These systems protect an organization’s assets and buildings from intruders, theft, etc. A CCTV system is used as part of the organization’s security system. It covers a large area and is often placed near gates, the reception, hallways, and at the workplace. It captures footage of illicit activities inside the premises and helps monitor activities inside, outside, and at the entrance. CCTV systems are even programmed to capture motion and initiate an alarm whenever a motion or an object is detected. They help identify activities that need attention, collect images as evidence, and aid in an alarm system. The devices used for video surveillance should be automatic, powerful, and capable of pan/tilt/zoom to capture the action and store them for later review.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Many aspects need to be considered for the installation, management, and maintenance of a video surveillance system in an organization; these include the camera, lens, resolution, recording time, recording equipment, cabling, monitoring system, storage devices, and centralized control system/equipment. Recording activities through CCTV and storing this footage for reference can also help facilities provide evidence in a court of law. It is also important to decide the type of lens, resolution, and area the camera should cover, and the time and date of the footage should be recorded. Another important aspect is the storage of video recordings and the storage duration. The organization must decide what will happen to old video recordings and how they will be disposed of.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are a few considerations for video surveillance systems:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Install surveillance systems at the parking lot, reception, lobby, and workstation.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Place output devices such as printers, scanners, and fax machine in public view and under surveillance.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Integrate surveillance with an alarm system.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Establish a policy for the duration for which recorded videos should be kept and later disposed.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Store all devices in secure locations with limited access.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use proper disposal procedures such as content deletion, overwriting, and physical destruction.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the different types of CCTV cameras available commercially.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dome CCTV</strong>: Mainly used for indoor security and surveillance purposes, dome CCTV cameras are built as dome-shaped devices to prevent any damage to the camera or destruction. It is impossible to locate the direction to which such cameras are moving; thus, they allow for observing areas at a wide angle and cover larger areas. Speed dome CCTV camera units provide a facility with pan/tilt/zoom and spin features, allowing the operator to move the camera according to their need.</li></ul></div>
