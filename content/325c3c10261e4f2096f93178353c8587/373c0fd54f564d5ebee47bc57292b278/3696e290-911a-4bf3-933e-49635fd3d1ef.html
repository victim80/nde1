  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a point-to-point topology, any two end points are considered as peer devices that can communicate with each other. Any of the devices can be used to initiate the connection. Unlike a hub-and-spoke topology, offices at different locations can directly communicate with each other without any IPsec failover. The IPsec technology assigned can be either IPsec or IPsec/GRE.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Regular IPsec point-to-point VPNs are commonly configured and known as extranets. This is where a connection is established between a device in a regularly managed network and an unmanaged device in the service providerâ€™s network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The major features of the point-to-point topology are as follows:</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Easy routing of data, which need to pass through only one router</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Optimal routing between customer sites</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Introduces encryption and authentication to confirm the integrity of packets in transit</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Uses a tunneling process to capture data packets with normal IP packets for forwarding over IP-based networks</li></ul></div>
