  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Symmetric encryption algorithms developed by RSA Security are discussed below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RC4</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">RC4 is a variable key-size symmetric-key stream cipher with byte-oriented operations, and it is based on the use of a random permutation. According to some analyses, the period of the cipher is likely to be greater than 10,100. Each output byte uses 8 to 16 system operations; thus, the cipher can run fast when used in software. RC4 enables safe communications such as for traffic encryption (which secures websites) and for websites that use the SSL protocol.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RC5</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">RC5 is a fast symmetric-key block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest for RSA Data Security (now RSA Security). The algorithm is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. The block sizes can be 32, 64, or 128 bits. The range of the rounds can vary from 0 to 255, and the size of the key can vary from 0 to 2,040 bits. This built-in variability can offer flexibility at all levels of security. The routines used in RC5 are key expansion, encryption, and decryption.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the key expansion routine, the secret key that a user provides is expanded to fill the key table (the size of which depends on the number of rounds). RC5 uses a key table for both encryption and decryption. The encryption routine has three fundamental operations: integer addition, bitwise XOR, and variable rotation. The intensive use of data-dependent rotation and the combination of different operations make RC5 a secure encryption algorithm.</p></div>
