  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Enhanced Data and Network Security:</strong> Organizations implement a policy based on their network, which enhances their data security. It facilitates protection when sharing information among other systems on a network.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> The risks involved from external sources are reduced by implementing and deploying security policy. If an employee follows the policy exactly, it becomes nearly impossible for an organization to lose its data and resources.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Monitored and Controlled Device Usage and Data Transfers: </strong>Although policies are being implemented thoroughly by employees, administrators should regularly monitor the traffic and external devices used in the system. Monitoring and auditing the incoming and outgoing traffic should always be done on regular intervals.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Better Network Performance:</strong> When security policies are implemented correctly and the network is monitored regularly, no unnecessary loads exist. The data transmission speed in the system increases, providing an overall performance enhancement.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Quick Response to Issues and Lower Downtime:</strong> Policy deployment and implementation enables faster response rates when resolving network issues.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Reduction in Management Stress Levels: </strong>The role of management becomes less stressful when policies are implemented. Every policy must be followed by every employee in an organization. If this occurs, management will be less burdened by potential malicious attacks on the network.</li><li><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> If employees follow the policies correctly, the cost of each intrusion is reduced as well as the impact on an organization.</li></ul></div>
