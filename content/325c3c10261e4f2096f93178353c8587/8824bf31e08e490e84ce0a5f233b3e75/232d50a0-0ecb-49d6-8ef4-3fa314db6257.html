  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">IDS products must meet certain criteria to be deployed in an organization. An organization should compare the different technology types and then select the most appropriate technology to meet its requirements. The products should be evaluated based on organizational requirements such as the following:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General requirements:</strong> An organization must have a clear baseline of the requirements for an IDS product. IDS solutions may differ in terms of features and services. The organization must determine which IDS product will best suit their requirements. For example, there are situations where a single IDS product may not satisfy the requirements of an organization. This scenario encourages the use of multiple IDS products. Wireless IDS products have certain general requirements such as a method of detecting anomalies and a process of connecting to other components, which determine whether the product can satisfy the company’s requirements. Evaluate the general requirements of the IDS products to meet post deployment. The number of IDS products needed also depends on the size of the organization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security capability requirements:</strong> The selection of an IDS depends on an organization’s environment and policies as well as the current security and network infrastructure. It is crucial to meet these as the product will be used in conjunction with other security controls.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Organizations should evaluate IDS security capability requirements as a baseline for creating a specific set of criteria. This is achieved by accounting for the organization’s environment, security policies, and network infrastructure. It is important to check and confirm the security capabilities of an IDS product. An IDS product that does not meet the required security capabilities is of no use as a security control, and a security professional must select a different product or use that product in combination with another security control. The IDS product should feature security capabilities such as information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance requirements:</strong> Evaluate IDS products based on their general performance characteristics.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Network-based IDS (NIDS)</strong>: This type of IDS has the ability to monitor and handle network traffic.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Host-based IDS (HIDS)</strong>: This type of IDS has the ability to monitor a certain number of events per second.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Security professionals should evaluate an IDS product’s general performance characteristics by assessing its capacity to handle network traffic or its packet monitoring capabilities for NIDS and event monitoring capabilities for HIDS.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management requirements:</strong> The products need to comply with the organization’s management policy to offer sufficient performance. If the product does not comply with the company’s policy, it would be difficult to handle it and make it work effectively.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lifecycle costs:</strong> IDS products are environment-specific, and it can be a tedious task for organizations to quantify the cost of IDS solutions. The cost of the IDS product should be proportional to the available budget of the organization. Estimated lifecycle costs of the selected IDS products should be in the range of the available funding. Selecting an IDS based on cost is difficult as the environment, security, and other networking criteria are likely to affect the cost.</li></ul></div>
