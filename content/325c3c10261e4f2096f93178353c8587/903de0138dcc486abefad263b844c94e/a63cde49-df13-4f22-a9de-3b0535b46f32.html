  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:center;">Figure 5.83: Hub-and-spoke VPN topology</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The figure clearly illustrates the hub-and-spoke topology. In the figure, each spoke at the branch offices establishes a secured connection with the hub at the main office. These secured connections are established across the Internet. The main office can have more than one hub at a time, but only one hub is used to connect to each spoke. The other hubs are kept as backup hubs for flexibility.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This topology works well if the traffic is between the hub and spoke, rather than between spokes or remote sites. This is because traffic between two spokes needs to pass through the hub before being forwarded to the respective spoke. This increases the chance of a bottleneck at the hub due to increased spoke-to-spoke connections. All IPsec technologies can be used in this topology.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If the hub faces any connection issue, IPsec failover transfers the connection to a backup hub to be used by all spokes. It is possible to configure multiple hubs as the main hub.</p></div>
