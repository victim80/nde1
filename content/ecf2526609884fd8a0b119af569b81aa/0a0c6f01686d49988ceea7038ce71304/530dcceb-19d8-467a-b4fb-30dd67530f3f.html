It is a combination of RAID level 1 and RAID level 0. It is also called as a “stripe of mirrors.” This level can symbolically be represented as RAID 1+0 or RAID 10. RAID 10 includes the mirroring of RAID 1 without parity and the striping of RAID 0. The performance of RAID 10 is higher than a RAID 1. RAID level 10 has the same fault tolerance as RAID level 1. It requires a minimum of four drives for its operation. RAID 10 is a great choice for database servers, web servers, email servers, etc., and can be implemented on hardware or software. The mirroring provides redundancy and improves performance. The data striping provides maximum performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of RAID Level 10</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved I/O operations:</strong> With a combination of RAID levels 1 and 0, it provides improved I/O operations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better throughput:</strong> Compared with other RAID levels, RAID 10 provides better throughput and higher latency.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Efficient write operations:</strong> The write operations are efficient in this level. Therefore, RAID 10 is often implemented on database servers and other servers that perform write operations.</li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of RAID Level 10</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expensive: </strong>RAID 10 is expensive than other RAID levels as it requires twice as many disks.</li></ul></div>
