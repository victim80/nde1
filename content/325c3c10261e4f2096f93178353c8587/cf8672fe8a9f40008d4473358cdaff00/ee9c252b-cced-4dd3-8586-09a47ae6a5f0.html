This server acts as a gateway for two-sided communications and drops data packets acting against the firewallâ€™s policy rules.</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Application-level gateways, also called proxies, concentrate on the application layer rather than just the packets.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They perform packet filtering at the application layer and make decisions about whether or not to transmit the packets.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A proxy-based firewall asks for authentication to pass the packets as it works at the application layer.&nbsp;</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Incoming or outgoing packets cannot access services for which there is no proxy. In plain terms, design of an application-level gateway helps it to act as a web proxy and drop packets such as FTP, gopher, Telnet, or any other traffic that should not be allowed to pass through.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">As packet filtering is performed at the application level, it is possible to filter application-specific commands such as GET or POST requests.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A content caching proxy optimizes performance by caching frequently accessed information instead of sending new requests for repetitive data transfers to the servers.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">An application-level firewall checks for those packets that do not comply with the filtration rules. The unauthorized packets are dropped, and authorized packets are forwarded to the application layer of the destination.</p></div>
