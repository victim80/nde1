  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Facilities may suffer blackouts or power outages that could make systems inoperable unless appropriate alternative power management capabilities are implemented. Power outages could impact the ability to provide IT services as expected as well as the ability to provide physical security. Power spikes, surges, or blackouts could result in excessive or insufficient power and could damage equipment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Consider the following security measures to handle blackouts or power outages.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Be prepared for power fluctuations.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to manage power outages.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Safeguard systems from environmental threats.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Protect systems from the adverse effects of static electricity at a workplace.</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Use plugging equipment properly.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">A UPS allows computers to function properly during a power failure. It protects computers during fluctuations in the power supply as well. A UPS contains a battery that senses power fluctuations in the primary device. Users need to save all their data when the UPS senses a power fluctuation. The operator must provide procedures to follow at the time of power loss. A UPS is commonly used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, etc.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The following are the different types of UPS include.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Standby</strong>: Standby UPSes are the most commonly used type of UPS for personal computers. A standby UPS is an offline battery backup facilitating the maintenance of the primary device during a power fluctuation. A standby power supply contains AC-DC circuitry that connects to the UPS during a power fluctuation.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Line interactive</strong>: Most commonly used for small business, web, and departmental servers, line interactive mainly handles continuous power fluctuations. This method of power supply needs very little battery usage.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Standby online hybrid</strong>: Most commonly used for server rooms, standby online hybrid UPSes are mainly used to supply power below 10 kVA. They are connected to the battery during a power failure.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Stand by Ferro</strong>: In this type of UPS, a Ferro resonant transformer is used for filtering the output. A standby Ferro UPS provides ample time for switching from the main power supply to battery power. This type of UPS is no longer commonly used because it becomes unstable when handling a modern computerâ€™s power load.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Double conversion online</strong>: Generally used in environments where electrical isolation is necessary, a double conversion online UPS is used to supply power above 10 kVA. It provides an ideal electric output presentation, but its power components are subject to continuous wear, reducing its dependability. It exhibits a transfer time only during a large current load.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Delta conversion online</strong>: A delta conversion online UPS can be useful when complete isolation and/or direct connectivity is required. It contains an inverter that supplies the load voltage. It can be used to supply power in the range between 5 kVA and 1 MW. It controls the power input performance and charging of the UPS battery.</li></ul></div>
