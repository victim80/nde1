IDS/IPS deployment should be done with careful planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training.</p><h3>Common Mistakes in IDS/IPS Configuration</h3><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Deploying an IDS in a location where it does not see all the network traffic</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Frequently ignoring the alerts generated by the IDS</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Not having the proper response policy and the best possible solutions to deal with an event</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Not fine-tuning the IDS for false negatives and false positives</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Not updating the IDS with the latest new signatures from the vendor</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Only monitoring inbound connections</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;">Included below are some mistakes and workarounds to avoid them for effective deployment of an IDS in the network:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deploying an IDS if the infrastructure planning is not efficient:</strong> An improper or incomplete network infrastructure will not help the functioning of an IDS. If the tuning of the IDS does not follow the network infrastructure, it has the potential to disable the network by flooding it with alerts.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incorrect sensitivity:</strong> After the deployment of an IDS, organizations usually set its level to the highest sensitivity enabling the IDS to detect a large number of attacks. However, this also leads to a rise in the number of false positives. If an IDS generates a large number of false positive alerts per day, it could cause the administrator to miss an actual alert. In the long run, ignoring these alerts can be harmful for network security.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Detecting an intrusion is not enough:</strong> Organizations should also design a response policy that administrators implement in response to an incident that has occurred. This response policy should answer the following questions: What is a normal event and what is a malicious event? What is the response for every event generating an alert? The person reviewing the alerts should be aware of this action plan.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NIDS without IPsec:</strong> An infrastructure that has established a NIDS without IPsec network protocols makes the network more vulnerable to intrusions. A NIDS listens to all the traffic that it senses and then compares the legitimacy of the traffic. If it encounters encrypted traffic, it can only perform packet-level analysis as the application layer contents are inaccessible. This increases the vulnerability of the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ignoring outbound traffic:</strong> Many organizations prefer securing and monitoring only the inbound traffic and ignore the outbound traffic. It is important to place IDS sensors throughout the organization. If the setup is cost effective, the organization should place the sensors near the choke points on the network. This will help monitor outbound as well as internal host network traffic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deploying IDS sensors on a single NIC or on multiple data links:&nbsp;</strong>This will lead to an IDS sensor sending the data on the same interface on which it is sensing. This may lead to a possible attack as the interface reports all the data to the centralized database. If an attacker gets access to this infrastructure, they can disable the IDS and prevent further alerts. The attacker can also intercept the data on the interface and alter it. This issue can be resolved by connecting the interface to a dedicated monitoring network.</li></ul></div>
