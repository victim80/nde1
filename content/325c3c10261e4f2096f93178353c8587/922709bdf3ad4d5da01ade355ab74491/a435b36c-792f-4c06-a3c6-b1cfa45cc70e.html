  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Never ignore a firewall’s limitations. Implementing a firewall without understanding its limitations may give one a false sense of security. Deploying a firewall solution that is not designed for a given task may fail to address the security risks the organization faces. Understanding the different types of firewalls and analyzing the limitations of each type will help in effectively balancing security with usability, performance, and cost.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Listed below are the typical limitations of firewalls:</p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not protect the network from backdoor attacks. For example, a disgruntled employee who cooperates with an external attacker.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not protect the network from insider attacks</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall cannot do anything if the network design and configuration is faulty</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall is not an alternative to antivirus or antimalware. If external devices such as a laptop, mobile phone, portable hard drive, etc. are already infected and connected to the network, then firewalls cannot protect the network in such instances.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not prevent new viruses. Firewalls are unable to fully protect the network from all types of zero-day viruses that may try to bypass them.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall cannot prevent social engineering threats. They cannot protect the network from social engineering, insiders, and data-driven attacks where the attacker sends malicious links and emails to employees inside the network.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not prevent passwords misuse</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not block attacks from a higher level of the protocol stack</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not protect against attacks originating from common ports and applications</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall does not protect against attacks from dial-in connections</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A firewall is unable to understand tunneled traffic</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Firewalls can restrict users from accessing valuable services such as FTP, Telnet, NIS, etc. and sometimes restrict Internet access as well.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Firewalls concentrate security at one single point, which makes other systems within the network prone to security attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">They can cause a bottleneck if all the connections pass through a firewall.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, firewalls have less computing speed than their network interface. This can create a problem when a host with a network interface is faster than the firewall’s internal processor.</li></ul></div>
