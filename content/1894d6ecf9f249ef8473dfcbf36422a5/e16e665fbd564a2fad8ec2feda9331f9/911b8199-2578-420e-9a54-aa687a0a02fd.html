If an organization has not implemented an adequate lighting system in and around its premises, the function or performance of all other security measures can be drastically degraded. For example, if the organization does not have lighting at rear corners, near bushes, plants, parking, and near surveillance cameras, then it is difficult to find people or objects hidden in these locations. With poor lighting, it is difficult to identify people entering the premises, and an intruder may act as an employee or use tricks to circumvent the security systems. The lighting systems to install in an area depend on the layout and sensitivity of the area. Alternate power systems such as generators should be installed to handle power failures and emergencies.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Continuous lighting</strong>: Continuous lighting refers to fixed sets of lights arranged such that they provide continuous lighting to a large area throughout the night.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Standby lighting</strong>: Standby lighting is used whenever any suspicious activity is detected by security personnel or by an alarm system. These systems operate either manually or automatically.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Movable lighting</strong>: Movable lighting is a manually controlled lighting system that provides lighting at night or only when needed. These systems are normally used as an extension of a continuous or standby lighting system.</li><li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Emergency lighting</strong>: Emergency lighting is used mainly during power failures or when other regular lighting systems fail to operate properly.</li></ul></div>
