  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">A VPN uses encryption to provide an additional layer of security to data transmitted over the VPN. Encryption plays an important role when sensitive data in an organization are transferred over the Internet. All data that enter the VPN tunnel are encrypted, and decryption is performed as soon as the data reach the end of the tunnel. An encryption key is used in the process of encryption and decryption. Encryption disables monitoring, logging, or tampering of the data in an organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Encryption helps secure the data passing through the network. The sender encrypts the data passing through the network, and the receiver decrypts the data. No encryption is required on the communication link between a dial-up client and the internal service provider, as the process of encryption occurs between the VPN client and VPN server. </p></div>
