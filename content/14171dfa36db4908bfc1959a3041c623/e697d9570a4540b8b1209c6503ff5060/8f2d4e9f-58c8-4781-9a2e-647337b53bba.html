  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The use of wireless devices in various organizations is continuously growing. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important for organizations to track and manage their wireless assets for security purposes. Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date inventory of wireless devices is required for proper security.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A network device inventory helps in consolidating all the updated network data and devices. The inventory can help in quickly identifying the non-functioning devices as well as rogue network devices that are present on the network. A list of devices that are not connected to the network should also be added to the list. This helps in detecting unknown devices in the network. A regular scanning of the inventory is important. Through scanning, the administrators can determine the rogue network devices, problematic devices, potential vulnerabilities, devices that need a patch/update, etc., in a network. A network is only as secure as its weakest link. Information about all the devices should be maintained regardless of their configuration settings or the vendor.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An inventory should be maintained either manually or with the help of an effective inventory tracking solution. At times, an inventory tool may not auto-update the network device. In such scenarios, information of a device should be manually added in the inventory list.</p></div>
