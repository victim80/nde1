  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Alarms are used to draw attention in case of a breach or an attempted breach. Alarm sounds can be of different types based on the facility; examples include sirens, flash lighting with a sound, emails, and/or voice alerts. The organization should divide large facilities such as buildings, floors, sections, and offices into small security zones; depending on their significance, the appropriate alarm system should be installed. Security zones that store high-priority data are given multilevel security systems such as access restriction with access control devices, biometrics, surveillance, locks, and alarms to draw attention in an event of intrusion. Alarms can be turned on either automatically or manually by smoke detectors, heat detectors, security personnel, etc. They should be audible to everyone in the building and set with three alerts to evacuate in intervals of 5 min. Organizations should have a proper power backup for alarm systems so that they work in emergencies and during power shutdowns. All wiring and components of an alarm should be protected from tampering, and the alarm box should be concealed with proper locks and limited access. Proper management and regular assessments of the alarm system should be performed with emergency drills.</p></div>
