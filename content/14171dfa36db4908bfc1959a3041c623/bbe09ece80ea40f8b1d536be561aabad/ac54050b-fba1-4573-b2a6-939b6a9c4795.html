  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">In a wireless network, data transmission occurs by means of electromagnetic waves that carry signals over the communication path.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Types of Wireless Technologies</strong></p><p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is a part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 family of wireless networking standards. This technology uses radio waves or microwaves to allow electronic devices to exchange data or connect to the Internet. Many devices such as personal computers, laptops, digital cameras, smartphones, etc., support Wi-Fi technology. Wi-Fi operates in the frequency band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. A Wi-Fi network uses radio waves to transmit the signals across the network. For this purpose, a computer should have a wireless adapter to translate the data into radio signals and pass them through an antenna and router. This is where the message is decoded, and the data is sent to the internet or through another network. Hotspots are areas that have Wi-Fi availability, where users can enable Wi-Fi on their devices and connect to the internet through a hotspot.</p><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">In the Bluetooth technology, data is transmitted between cell phones, computers, and other networking devices over short distances. Signals transmitted via Bluetooth cover short distances of up to 10 m as compared to other modes of wireless communication. Bluetooth transfers the data at a speed of less than 1 Mbps and operates in the frequency range of 2.4 GHz. This technology comes under IEEE 802.15 and uses a radio technology called FHSS for transferring data to other Bluetooth-enabled devices.</p><p><strong>RFID</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology uses radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves to transfer data for automatic identification and for tracking tags attached to objects. RFID devices work within a small range of up to 20 ft.</p><p><strong>WiMAX</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) technology uses long distance wireless networking and high-speed Internet. It belongs to the IEEE 802.16 family of wireless networking standards. WiMAX signals can function over a distance of several miles with data rates reaching up to 75 Mbps. It uses a fixed wireless application and mobile stations to provide high-speed data, voice, video calls, and internet connectivity to users. The WiMAX forum developed WiMAX and states that nearly 135 countries have deployed over 455 WiMAX networks.</p></div>
