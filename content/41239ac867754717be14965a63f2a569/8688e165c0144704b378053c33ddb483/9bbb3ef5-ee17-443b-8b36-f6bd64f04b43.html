It is often described as the law that keeps citizens informed about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions that protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://it.ojp.gov</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Stored Wire Electronic Communications Act are commonly referred together as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986. The ECPA updated the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed interception of conversations using "hard" telephone lines, but did not apply to interception of computer and other digital and electronic communications. Several subsequent pieces of legislation, including The USA PATRIOT Act, clarify and update the ECPA in order to keep pace with the evolution of new communications technologies and methods, including easing restrictions on law enforcement access to stored communications in some cases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Human Rights Act 1998</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.legislation.gov.uk</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This Act buttresses the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights; it makes provision with respect to holders of certain judicial offices who become judges of the European Court of Human Rights, and for other related purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Freedom of Information Act 2000</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source<strong>:</strong> <em>https://www.legislation.gov.uk</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">This Act makes provision for the disclosure of information held by public authorities or by persons providing services for them and to amend the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Public Records Act 1958, and for related purposes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source<strong>:<em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>https://ilt.eff.org</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. § 1030, is an amendment made in 1986 to the Counterfeit Access Device and Abuse Act 1984, and essentially states that, whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains information from any protected computer, and if the conduct involves an interstate or foreign communication, shall be punished under the Act. In 1996 the CFAA was, again, broadened by an amendment that replaced the term “federal interest computer” with the term “protected computer” 18 U.S.C. § 1030. While the CFAA is primarily a criminal law intended to reduce the instances of malicious interferences with computer systems and address federal computer offenses, an amendment in 1994 allows civil actions to be brought under the statute as well.</p></div>
