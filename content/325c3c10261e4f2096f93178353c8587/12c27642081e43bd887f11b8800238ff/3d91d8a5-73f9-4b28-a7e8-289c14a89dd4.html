  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Network sensors are hardware and software components that monitor network traffic and trigger alarms if any abnormal activity is detected. It is a primary data collection point for the IDS. Network sensors collect data from the data source and pass it to the alert systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The sensor integrates with the component responsible for data collection such as an event generator. Network sensors determine data collection based on the event generator policy, which defines the filtering mode for event notification information.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The role of the sensor is to filter information and discard any irrelevant data obtained from the event set associated with the protected system, thereby detecting suspicious activities. Sensors check the traffic for malicious packets, trigger an alarm when they suspect a packet is malicious, and then alert the IDS. If an IDS confirms the packet as malicious then the sensors generate an automatic response to block the traffic from the source of the attack.</p></div>
