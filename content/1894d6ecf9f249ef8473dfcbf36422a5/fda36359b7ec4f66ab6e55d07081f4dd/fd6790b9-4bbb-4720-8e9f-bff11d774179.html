Warning signs are placed at entrance points, boundaries of the locality, and sensitive areas. They should be visible to users such that people understand prohibited areas and avoid entering them. Warning signs also help organizations prevent a large number of people from entering sensitive areas. They are generally placed in all sensitive areas that have a threat of damage to assets or life or disclosure of information. For example, warning signs are typically placed on electrical fences because unknowingly touching the electric fence may pose a threat to life. Examples of warning signs are “RESTRICTED AREA,” “WARNING,” “CAUTION,” “DANGER,” and “BEWARE.”</p></div>
