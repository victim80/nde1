  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">The common goal of disk encryption tools is to encrypt a disk partition to provide confidentiality to the information stored on it. Some disk encryption tools are discussed below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>VeraCrypt</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>https://www.veracrypt.fr</em></p><p style="text-align:justify;">VeraCrypt is a software for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume (data storage device). On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted just before it is saved and decrypted just after it is loaded without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. The entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names, folder names, free space, metadata, etc.).</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Files can be copied to and from a mounted VeraCrypt volume just like they are copied to/from any normal disk (e.g., by simple drag-and-drop operations). Files are automatically decrypted on the fly (in memory/RAM) while they are read or copied from an encrypted VeraCrypt volume. Similarly, files that are written or copied to the VeraCrypt volume are automatically encrypted on the fly (just before they are written to the disk) in RAM.</p></div>
