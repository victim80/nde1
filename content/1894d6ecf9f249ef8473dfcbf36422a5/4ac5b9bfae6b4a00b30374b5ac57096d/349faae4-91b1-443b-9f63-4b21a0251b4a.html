  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Physical security controls are categorized based on their functionality and the plane of application. Based on their functionality, the types of physical security control include the following.</p><p><strong>Preventive Controls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These controls prevent security violations and enforce various access control mechanisms. Preventive controls may be physical, administrative, or technical. Examples include door locks and security guards.</p><p><strong>Detective Controls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These controls detect security violations and record any intrusion attempts. They act when preventive controls fail. Examples include motion detectors, alarm systems and sensors, and video surveillance.</p><p><strong>Deterrent Controls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These controls may not prevent access directly. They are used to discourage attackers and send warning messages to them to discourage an intrusion attempt. Examples include various types of warning signs.</p><p><strong>Recovery Controls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These controls are used in serious situations to recover from security violations and restore information and systems to a persistent state. Examples include disaster recovery, business continuity plans, and backup systems.</p><p><strong>Compensating Controls</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;">These controls are used as alternatives when the primary controls fail or cannot be used. They do not prevent any attack attempt but attempt restoration using techniques such as restoring from a backup. Examples include hot sites and backup power systems.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the plane of application, the types of security controls include the following.</p><ul><li style="text-align:justify;">Physical security controls such as doors, secure facilities, fire extinguishers, and flood protection</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Administrative security controls such as the organizationâ€™s policies, procedures, and guidelines to provide information security</li><li style="text-align:justify;">Technical security controls such as IDSes/IPSes, firewalls, and authentication systems</li></ul></div>
