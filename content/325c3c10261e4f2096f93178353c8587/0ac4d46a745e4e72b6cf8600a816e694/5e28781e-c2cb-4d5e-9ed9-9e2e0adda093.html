  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of firewalls.</p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hardware Firewalls</strong></h4><p style="text-align:justify;">A hardware firewall is a dedicated firewall device placed on the perimeter of the network. It is an integral part of the network setup and is also built into broadband routers or used as a standalone product. A hardware firewall helps to protect systems on the local network and performs effectively with little or no configuration. It employs the technique of packet filtering. It reads the header of a packet to find out the source and destination addresses and compares them with a set of predefined and/or user-created rules that determine whether it should forward or drop the packet. A hardware firewall functions on an individual system or a particular network connected using a single interface. Examples of hardware firewalls include Cisco ASA and FortiGate. Hardware firewalls protect the private local area network.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, hardware firewalls are expensive as well as difficult to implement and upgrade.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Security: A hardware firewall with its operating system (OS) is considered to reduce security risks and increase the level of security controls.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Speed: Hardware firewalls initiate faster responses and enable more traffic.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Minimal Interference: Since a hardware firewall is a separate network component, it enables better management and allows the firewall to shut down, move, or be reconfigured without much interference in the network.</li></ul><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">More expensive than a software firewall.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Difficult to implement and configure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Consumes more space and involves cabling.</li></ul></div>
