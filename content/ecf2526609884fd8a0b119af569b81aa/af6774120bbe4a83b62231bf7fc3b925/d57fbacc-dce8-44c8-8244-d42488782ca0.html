  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">NAS is a storage device connected to a network. It stores and retrieves data from a centralized location. NAS provides a dedicated shared storage space for a local area network. Implementing a NAS eradicates the server file sharing process on the network. The NAS contains one or more logically arranged storage devices. NAS offers file storage through a standard Ethernet connection.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">NAS devices do not use an external device management, and they are operated through a web-based utility. Since it resides on every node on the LAN, it has its own IP address. NAS is similar to a file server. NAS devices are scalable, vertically as well as horizontally. A NAS implementation is accomplished using large and clustered disks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">NAS has evolved from supporting virtualization to data replication and multiprotocol access. A clustered NAS is one such example of the NAS evolution. In a clustered NAS infrastructure, access is provided to all files, irrespective of their physical location. It does not require a closed-source operating system such as Windows. Certain devices run on a stripped down OS such as FreeNAS, or any other open-source solutions.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">NAS devices are in high demand in small enterprises because of their effectiveness, low cost, and scalable storage capacity. They are classified into three types based on the number of drives, drive capacity, and scalability.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Advantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accessibility: </strong>A NAS system stores data as files and is compatible with CIFS and NFS protocols. Multiple users can access the files simultaneously using an Ethernet network. Computers in a shared network can access the data either through a wireless or a wired connection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Storage:</strong> NAS deployment in a network increases the amount of storage available to the other systems. A NAS system can store up to 8 TB data. A NAS is most appropriate for storing large applications or video files.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Efficient and Reliable: </strong>NAS assures an efficient transfer of data and reliable network access. If a system in a network fails, the functioning of other systems is not affected. A NAS server can also be created to give users the ability to access large files or applications.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic backup:</strong> Certain NAS devices are configured with an automatic backup feature. The data is available on the user system as well as on the server hard drive. Changes made on the user system are reflected on the server hard drive as well. Automatic backup is not time consuming and assures the security of data.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Compatibility: </strong>Users with different operating systems can share files with no compatibility issues.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A NAS can be connected to a LAN using the plug and play feature.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Minimal administration required, unlike Unix or NT file servers.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Centralized usage, and reduced cost of backup and maintenance than a SAN.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Faster response than direct attached storage (DAS).</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consumption:</strong> NAS shares the network with other host machines, and this tends to consume a larger amount of network bandwidth. For remote NAS systems, the data transfer performance will depend on the available bandwidth. It is advisable to avoid storing databases on a NAS, as the server response time fluctuates depending on the bandwidth. Applications that use most of the data transfer bandwidth will significantly reduce network performance.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network congestion: </strong>A large backup process can affect the function of an IP network and may lead to network congestion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Data transfer is inefficient as it uses TCP/IP instead of a specialized data transfer protocol.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The storage service cannot be trusted for mission-critical operations.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Administrators must set user quotas for storage space.</li></ul></div>
