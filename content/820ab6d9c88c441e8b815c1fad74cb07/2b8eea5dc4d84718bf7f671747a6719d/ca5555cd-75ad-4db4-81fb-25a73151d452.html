  <div class="row" data-content-type="TextEditor"><p style="text-align:justify;">Because IoT devices are vastly different from each other, the security of devices relies on their type and model. With no or inadequate focus on IoT device security by manufacturers, security measures used for IoT devices often fall short. Therefore, an organization should focus on securing IoT devices and countering attack scenarios in IoT-enabled environments.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An organization can secure IoT devices by changing the default passwords, disabling unused features, updating firmware and applications, and using a legitimate application developed by a reliable vendor in the case of IoT devices that rely on third-party applications.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An adversary uses a compromised IoT device as an entry point to a network and performs a lateral movement attack. For example, a compromised smart printer can infect other systems and devices connected to the same network. A compromised router can spread malware to all the IoT devices connected to it. Therefore, organizations should focus on securing network devices and routers in an IoT-enabled environment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">To secure an IoT network and router, the user should map and monitor all the devices, apply network segmentation, ensure a secure network architecture, use routers with in-built firewalls, and disable unnecessary services such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). This helps in restricting the attacker from accessing other parts of the network and performing targeted attacks.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">An organization should use multi-layered management. To secure all the different IoT devices, an overarching multi-layered security plan and constant maintenance are required. The organization should enforce security solutions that safeguard the IoT devices and detect malware at the endpoint level. It should also use security software that checks the network traffic between routers and connected devices to protect the IoT devices. Further, it should utilize network appliances to monitor all the ports and network protocols for detecting advance threats and safeguard the IoT devices from targeted attacks. Company-wide collaboration and synchronization are required to secure an IoT-enabled environment.</p></div>
